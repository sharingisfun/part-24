The bulk of the video is concert footage, with a mock interview interspersed between each song. Additionally, three music videos - &quot;Saddam a Go-Go,&quot; &quot;Meat Sandwich,&quot; and &quot;Surf of Syn&quot; - are among the scenes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a1330538ffd8105ad8a0d6c914edad2901d212b","amp;dn":"GWAR+Rendezvous+with+Ragnarok","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a1330538ffd8105ad8a0d6c914edad2901d212b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,19,48,83,143,253,129,5,173,138,13,108,145,78,218,210,144,29,33,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
