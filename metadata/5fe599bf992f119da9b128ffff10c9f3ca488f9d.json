Episode 3 is the original number for the downloaded file but Episode 1 is the most likely right number that I found on the web from its description.  I've also added the title to the original file's name.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fe599bf992f119da9b128ffff10c9f3ca488f9d","amp;dn":"Storage.Hunters.S03E03.%28s03e01.Buried.Alive%29.HDTV.x264-CRiMSON.m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fe599bf992f119da9b128ffff10c9f3ca488f9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,229,153,191,153,47,17,157,169,177,40,255,255,16,201,243,202,72,143,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
