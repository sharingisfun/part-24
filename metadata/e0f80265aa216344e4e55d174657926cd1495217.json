The Canadian singer-songwriter caused a brief buzz back in the mid 1990s with his debut, Everything I Long For, a minor alt-folk release in the Sebadoh or Beck vein. Since then, however, he hasn't had a hit song or a big album, nor has he shown up on a soundtrack or in a major ad campaign. His lyrics are precise and expressive, but he's not really a songwriter's songwriter. His range is limited, but he's not a cult artist either. In fact, his music tends to be understated to a fault: slow and mopey and not always reliable, like ca. 96 dial-up. And yet, here we are, talking about his latest effort, Us Alone.
