An 8-year-old American boy wakes up alone in a rice paddy in a rural Chinese province with no idea how he got there. Details start to emerge when the boy, who calls himself Jacob, recalls that his hometown is Arcadia, and an Immigration agent, Martin Bellamy, takes him there. The home he claims as his own is occupied by an elderly couple, Harold and Lucille Garland, who lost their son Jacob more than 30 years ago. While they look different, young Jacob recognizes them as his parents. Those closest to the family try to unravel this impossible mystery, including Sheriff Fred Garland, whose wife Barbara drowned 30 years ago while trying to save Jacob. But this boy who claims to be the deceased Jacob knows secrets about his own death that no one else knows -- secrets that FredÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, Gail, will begin to investigate and discover to be true.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32d9fee2f0c5e80f261fa807d03da4e0ac1d73a7","amp;dn":"Resurrection.US.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32d9fee2f0c5e80f261fa807d03da4e0ac1d73a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,217,254,226,240,197,232,15,38,31,168,7,208,61,164,224,172,29,115,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
