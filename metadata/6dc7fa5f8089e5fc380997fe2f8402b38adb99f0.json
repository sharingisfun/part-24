Life extension therapies have increased the human lifespan by centuries. Loyal mentars (artificial intelligences) and robots do most of society's work. The Boutique Economy has made redundant ninety-nine percent of the world's fifteen billion human inhabitants. The world would be a much better place if they all simply went away.\n\nEleanor K. Starke, one of the world's leading citizens is assassinated, and her daughter, Ellen, is mortally wounded. Only Ellen, the heir to her mother's financial empire, is capable of saving Earth from complete domination plotted by the cynical, selfish, immortal rich, that is if she survives. Her cryonically frozen head is in the hands of her family's enemies. A ragtag ensemble of unlikely heroes join forces to rescue Ellen's head, all for their own purposes.\n\nCounting Heads arrives as a science fiction novel like a bolt of electricity, galvanizing readers with an entirely new vision of the future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc7fa5f8089e5fc380997fe2f8402b38adb99f0","amp;dn":"David+Marusek+-+Counting+Heads+%28Counting+Heads+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc7fa5f8089e5fc380997fe2f8402b38adb99f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,199,250,95,128,137,229,252,56,9,151,254,47,132,2,179,138,219,153,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
