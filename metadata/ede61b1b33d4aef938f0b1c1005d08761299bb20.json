The other files are fine.  John Cleese (Monty Python, Fawlty Towers) makes an incredible narrator expecially for a work like this.  The entire book consists of a series of letters written from a mid-management demon from hell to his nephew who is a field demon learning the art of tempting humans.  The nephew is assigned one man in particular, where you are apt to place yourself.\n\nForget the demons.  Think about sin and the motives behind it.  This is an amazing book, IMHO.  I like it even better in audio format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ede61b1b33d4aef938f0b1c1005d08761299bb20","amp;dn":"Screwtape+Letters+-+C.+S.+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ede61b1b33d4aef938f0b1c1005d08761299bb20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,230,27,27,51,212,174,249,56,240,177,193,0,93,8,118,18,153,187,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
