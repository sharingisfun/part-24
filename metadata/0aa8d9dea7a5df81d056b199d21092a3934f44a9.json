You may encounter a DirectX error when using the Launcher, even though you have DirectX installed. (-&gt; do not use LaunchBFII.exe)\n\n\nAnother issue, which is much worse, is the CTD(crash to desktop) when starting a game. SWBF2 seems to require an active audio recording device.\nSolutions:                                        Ãƒâ€º\n1. Disable your sound card (...)\n2. &quot;Install&quot; stereomix. -&gt; google (tl;dr: requires older/different sound driver or different sound card. If you are lucky you have it, but it is disabled)\n3. Put any audio jack into your microphone socket. Yes, that actually works.\n\n\nThere is a keygen (rld-swbf2kg.exe) in the game directory, should you need to change your serial (e.g. for LAN mode).(use CDKey.exe in the folder Install for that)\n\n\n1. Mount or unpack .iso\n2. Install\n3. Play\n(4. Plug in microphone)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aa8d9dea7a5df81d056b199d21092a3934f44a9","amp;dn":"Star.Wars.Battlefront.2.REPACK-vol1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aa8d9dea7a5df81d056b199d21092a3934f44a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,168,217,222,167,165,223,129,208,86,177,153,210,16,146,163,147,79,68,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
