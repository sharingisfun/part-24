Their music has been used in movies, television shows, and commercials, heard in diverse venues, from &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; to Volkswagen. \n\nClannad have given a unique voice to modern Irish music. They have combined a deep love of traditional strains with a bold approach to writing and recording. Their legacy is a hugely impressive collection of albums, touching on folk, rock, ambient, jazz and world music. Many of these records have featured lyrics in their native Gaelic tongue, while others have been performed in English. Either way, those vocals have plugged directly into the popular imagination.\n\n\nClannad continues to enjoy success and has made almost twenty albums to date. In recent years, Clannad has not toured or recorded on a regualr basis. The last studio album was Landmarks, released in 1997.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2432 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x552\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.275:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 41:23.560\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 798 MB\nEncoded by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3298427cecae2648809dc17834be76badcaa4850","amp;dn":"Clannad.Past.and.Present.XviD.AC3.MVGroup.Forum.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3298427cecae2648809dc17834be76badcaa4850","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,152,66,124,236,174,38,72,128,157,193,120,52,190,118,186,220,170,72,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
