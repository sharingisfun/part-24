Some albums remain unheard in piles of promotional CDs; others emerge by chance after a lengthy hibernation to make a delayed march to the disc player. Lucky for us, UK bard David Thomas Broughton&amp;#039;s excellent The Complete Guide To Insufficiency falls into the second camp. I&amp;#039;ve never been a huge fan of Plug Research, largely because experimental electronic music isn&amp;#039;t my thing. On top of label bias, The Complete Guide&amp;#039;s bland cover art and generic title are ill-fitting. Overlooking these initial strikes, I played the album anyway only to find myself hitting repeat, literally for hours.\n\nThat was a couple of months ago; now, along with Richard Youngs&amp;#039; NaÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ve Shaman and Six Organs of Admittance&amp;#039;s Compathia, Broughton&amp;#039;s acid-folk cycle is a late-night favorite. Dripping with inky ambience, his hypnotic sick-souled mantras are simpler than Chasny&amp;#039;s and comparable to Youngs&amp;#039; recent outings, but without the playful Arthur Russell flourishes. Broughton keeps the instrumentation spare: acoustic guitar, looping pedals, minimal drum machine, well-spaced accents (distortion streaks, bells, wooden percussion). At the center is his gorgeous hangdog voice, which recalls a less taciturn Nick Drake with the vocal mannerisms of Antony blended into the dusty, mystical ambiance of Vashti Bunyan.\n\nBroughton&amp;#039;s a patient conjuror, allowing five tracks to clock in at just under 40 minutes. Reportedly recorded in a single take at Wrangthorn Church Hall in Leeds, the compositions bleed together with only slight variation. The church wasn&amp;#039;t simply a goth gimmick; the building really seeps into the songs. For example, the bells that close &quot;Unmarked Grave&quot; were supposedly a mistake, a fortunate byproduct of putting things to tape between the incense and pews.\n\nThe first track, &quot;Ambiguity&quot;, opens on two minutes of guitar, looped frontward then backward, as if buoying Broughton&amp;#039;s lyrics, which are both darkly surreal and heartbroken. &quot;Ambiguity&quot;&amp;#039;s actual incantation begins with existential questioning: &quot;How much love can a boy contain in here? How many contradictions can a girl posses up there?&quot; When the song&amp;#039;s pace subtly quickens, he moves into the realm of declarations: &quot;It&amp;#039;s easy to forget where you came from, if there&amp;#039;s no question of your return.&quot; The line most indicative of the album&amp;#039;s atmosphere-- draped in suicide, murder, and insecurity-- closes the piece: &quot;I struggle with the nightshade in my blood/ I really shouldn&amp;#039;t say it, I really shouldn&amp;#039;t say it/ But, I just love what the water does.&quot; Then, when he&amp;#039;s said his peace, Broughton doubles his voice-- a technique recalling Antony&amp;#039;s gospelisms. These moments of non-articulation, of self-harmonizing are typically the standouts of any given track.\n\nThe next piece, &quot;Execution&quot; starts with Broughton&amp;#039;s ohms alongside his playing and tapping of a guitar. Once the somber, plodded mood&amp;#039;s established, he layers a vocal line over the backing track. Lyrically, it&amp;#039;s a bit of a love song: &quot;I wouldn&amp;#039;t take her to an execution/ I wouldn&amp;#039;t take her to a live sex show/ I wouldn&amp;#039;t piss or shit on her, would I?/ Because I love her so.&quot; Scat fans may find this a narrow definition of a relationship, but the point&amp;#039;s well taken: It&amp;#039;s an I would walk 500 miles kinda thing for the down and out.\n\nSurprisingly, &quot;Unmarked Grave&quot;, the tale of a soldier&amp;#039;s rotting body and his lonesome gal, is just about joyful in the aftermath of &quot;Execution&quot;&amp;#039;s ominousness. (Tellingly, the dead guy&amp;#039;s mortally wounded with arrows-- Broughton is often reminiscent of some Medievalist, and death by machine gun wouldn&amp;#039;t seem right.) It&amp;#039;s here the gentle church bells lend the track a funereal beauty, etching themselves into Broughton&amp;#039;s one-man, multi-tracked Gregorian chant.\n\nThe album&amp;#039;s weakest song, &quot;Walking Over You&quot;, is also its most conventional and, thankfully, its briefest. Closer &quot;Ever Rotating Sky&quot; ostensibly looks at cannibalism/rape (&quot;The violation of your body, the pieces they fall into the holes, flakes of skin in my mouth, petals trodden into the carpet&quot;), and it resembles the three stronger earlier tracks on a noisier tip. For the last gasp, Broughton carts in a tinny drum machine (rattles/clicks/report), cutting his voice and the instruments into a patch of Reichian chaos. The dicing and reconfiguring eventually mutates &quot;rotating sky&quot; into &quot;rotting inside.&quot; It&amp;#039;s an eerie though perhaps unintentional effect.\n\nThe Complete Guide To Insufficiency might be too homogenous for some, but fans of folk&amp;#039;s apocalyptic, alchemical side (&amp;#039;sup, David Tibet) won&amp;#039;t have much to complain about. Over the past year, neo-folk&amp;#039;s continued to spin into different bifurcations; the glossy hipsters-as-hippies proving less interesting than artists mining stranger material. Aligning himself with scratchy brethren like Nick Castro, Badgerlore, Devendra Banhart&amp;#039;s earlier self, and the aforementioned Youngs and Chasny, David Thomas Broughton&amp;#039;s debut ought to catapult him somewhere near the head of the bearded class, even if his stateside peers have yet to let these brilliant psalms work their magic.\n\n-Brandon Stosuy, January 17, 2006\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:319fc228d64cc4c22cb45dc8eed69303457a4eca","amp;dn":"David+Thomas+Broughton+-+The+Complete+Guide+to+Insufficiency+%5B20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"319fc228d64cc4c22cb45dc8eed69303457a4eca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,159,194,40,214,76,196,194,44,180,93,200,238,214,147,3,69,122,78,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
