This is widely known as 'Ian Levine's Shada.'\n\nFrom A Fan:\n\nThis is what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done.\n \nBasically, this is IanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shada Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but has been re-mastered to replace the VHS footage with DVD footage.\n \nIt has also been re-edited to flow better and to make its running time to similar to a standard BBC running time. This involved the loss of a lot of padding and general tightening up of the original version. (The original was nearly 20 minutes longer).  [Uploader's note: A Fan is referring to losing the padding in the animated scenes.]\n \nIt has also had foley work done to add in sound effects and the like that had been left of from LevineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original.\n\n I just want the fans to see and be able to have what he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59a47af095b9b86b85cb8a5452f90552e9ad2f76","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Shada+Ian+Levine+Special+Edition+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59a47af095b9b86b85cb8a5452f90552e9ad2f76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,164,122,240,149,185,184,107,133,203,138,84,82,249,5,82,233,173,47,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
