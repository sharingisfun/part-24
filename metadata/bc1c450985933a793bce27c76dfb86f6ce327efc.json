This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Which recording act in the history of the album chart has had the longest name?&quot; Until 1972 it was, &quot;The Baroque Ensemble of the Merseyside Mermusy Gaselshaf.&quot; Casey tells who put them in second place.\t\n\nOne listener writes, &quot;Dear Casey, Several times I've heard you refer to disappearing acts; artists whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had one chart single that went to number one, and then were never heard from again. But I'd like to know about disappearing acts on the album chart.&quot;\n\nThere is a singer/song-writer in the countdown with his first top 40 hit who failed his high school music class. Now the same teacher who once flunked him is using his songs to teach the class!\n\nThis countdown has the most recent smash by the lady superstar who's had more top ten albums than any other female artist in the history of the charts; more than Doris Day, Aretha Franklin, or even Carole King.\n\nOne act in the countdown got their big debut on the Grouch Marx Quiz Show, right after their parents correctly answered the question, &quot;How many prongs are on a fork?&quot;\n\n40:    The Things We Do For Love - 10CC\n39:    I Like To Do It - K.C. &amp; The Sunshine Band\n38:    Boogie Child - The Bee Gees            \n37:    It Keeps You Runnin' - The Doobie Brothers\n36:    Living Next Door To Alice - Smokie\n35:    You've Got Me Runnin' - Gene Cotton\n34:    I Never Cry - Alice Cooper\n33:    Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word - Elton John\n32:    Go Your Own Way - Fleetwood Mac\n31:    Save It For A Rainy Day - Stephen Bishop\n30:    Don't Leave Me This Way - Thelma Houston\n29:    Stand Tall - Burton Cummings\n28:    Livin' Thing - The Electric Light Orchestra\n27:    Whispering/Cherchez La Femme/Se Si Bon        \n26:    Dancing Queen - Abba\n25:    Night Moves - Bob Seger\n24:    Year Of The Cat - Al Stewart\n23:    Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing - Donny &amp; Marie Osmond\n22:    Tonight's The Night (Gonna Be Alright) - Rod Stewart\n21:    Saturday Nite - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n20:    Hard Luck Woman - Kiss\n19:    After The Lovin' - Englebert Humperdinck\n18:    You Don't Have To Be A Star (To Be In My Show) - Marilyn McCoo &amp; Billy Davis Jr.\n17:    Jeans On - David Dundas\n16:    Weekend In New England - BarRy Manilow\n15:    Fly Like An Eagle - The Steve Miller Band\n14:    I Like Dreamin' - Kenny Nolan\n13:    Somebody To Love - Queen\n12:    Lost Without Your Love - Bread\n11:    Enjoy Yourself - The Jacksons\n10:    Walk This Way - Aerosmith\n9:    Love Theme From &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (Evergreen) - Barbra Streisand\n8:    Blinded By The Light - Manfred Mann's Earth Band\n7:    Torn Between Two Lovers - Mary MacGregor\n6:    New Kid In Town - The Eagles\n5:    Hot Line - The Sylvers\n4:    You Make Me Feel Like Dancing - Leo Sayer\n3:    Dazz - Brick\n2:    I Wish - Stevie Wonder\n1:    Car Wash - Rose Royce\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc1c450985933a793bce27c76dfb86f6ce327efc","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1977_January_29th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc1c450985933a793bce27c76dfb86f6ce327efc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,28,69,9,133,147,58,121,59,206,39,199,109,251,134,246,206,50,126,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
