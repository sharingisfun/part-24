The band included Tony King, Bernie Calvert of the Hollies, Roger Pope and Caleb Quaye of Hookfoot (and Elton John's late 70's band), Jamaican percussionists Lennox Jackson and Rolfo, and Reg Dwight (later known as Elton John). This instrumental album was recorded during sessions in 1968 and 1969 and included Chris Thomas as a producer. This album was never released and featured psychedelic jazz interpretations of earlier hits. Elton John played harpsichord on &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot; and electric and acoustic piano on the other tracks. As I previously noted, this album was never released (although a couple of tracks from these sessions were, but aren't included here) and Tony King gave the master tapes to Elton as a 1976 birthday gift.\n\nThe Band:\nTony King\nBernie Calvert\nRoger Pope\nCaleb Quaye\nLennox Jackson\nRolfo\nReg Dwight (Elton John)\n\n\nThe Songs:\n\nWoolly Bully  \nMellow Yellow  \nIf I Were A Carpenter  \nZorba The Greek  \nThe Letter  \nQuick Joey Small  \nNeedles And Pins  \nGod Knows (A Bit Of Freedom)  \nBilly's Bag  \nLast Night  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f830c60f09a7ae372357b0dd3a1ba19805906a8","amp;dn":"1969+Bread+and+Beer+Band-+Featuring+Reg+Dwight+%28Elton+John%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f830c60f09a7ae372357b0dd3a1ba19805906a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,131,12,96,240,154,122,227,114,53,123,13,211,161,186,25,128,89,6,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
