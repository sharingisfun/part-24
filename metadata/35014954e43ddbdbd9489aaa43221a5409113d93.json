The editor and contributors provide an important review of this exciting technology and its growing range of applications. After an introduction to nanomedicine, part one discusses key materials and their properties, including nanocrystalline metals and alloys, nanoporous gold and hydroxyapatite coatings. The middle sections review nanomedicine for therapeutics and imaging and discuss nanomedicine for soft tissue engineering, going over organ regeneration, skin grafts, nanotubes and self-assembled nanomaterials. The final group of chapters focuses on nanomedicine for bone and cartilage tissue engineering, investigating electrically active biocomposites as smart scaffolds, cartilage and bone tissue engineering, regeneration and replacement.
