There is even an unconfirmed sighting of Ben Harper in an early cut of the film.\n\nThe all-original score for the project is being headed by Joachim Cooder (from the Grammy winning documentary the &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;) and is turning out to be an eclectic piece of art on it's own. We can only imagine the various artists he has in store for the ever-changing mood of the film.\n\nAs far as surfing goes, there are over thirty hours of footage that according to Brad Gerlach is &quot;the best surfing I've ever seen&quot;. It's been cut down to an hour by directors Taylor Steele and Chris Malloy with a hand from Emmett Malloy and Jack Johnson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17efbf15dbb4a87b2366b106742ed108718217ca","amp;dn":"%5BSURF%5D+Shelter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17efbf15dbb4a87b2366b106742ed108718217ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,239,191,21,219,180,168,123,35,102,177,6,116,46,209,8,113,130,23,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
