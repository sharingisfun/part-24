Sure, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d self-recorded many times \nin the past, but it was a pretty amateurish affair. This time, we wanted to get the most out of the recording sessions.  \n\nBeing a lurker on the Electrical Audio forums, I was seeing so much useful \ninformation scattered all over the place, and thinking that it would be nice if all that stuff was condensed into a book. Since no one else was going to do it for me... \n\nThings started getting out of hand, and it grew into this monster. It could never be the ultimate encyclopedia on Electrical Audio or Steve AlbiniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recording methods, since new things get discovered everyday, but at 433 pages + 3 massive equipment annexes (total page count: 506), I feel that all my objectives regarding this work were accomplished. All the main things that I wanted to know about recording are answered here. And in case someone wants to print it for personal use, adding more information would just make the whole work unreadable and messy. \n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not a book writer, and this was compiled to suit my own personal taste. \nWhenever I saw information that seemed relevant to me, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d copy it to my PC. \nSince reading recording info for hours and hours can drive anyone crazy, I started inserting any funny jokes that I met along the way (hence the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBad JokesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mentioned in the title). Therefore, there might be a lot of stuff here that might not matter to you. Sorry about that, but I still hope it can be useful for you guys...  \n\nI have a life as well, and this project has taken me many sleepless nights. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s at the stage where I feel I can share it with others, and let it finally rest in peace. Although I would have wished to do a second annex with GregÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Journal, I doubt I would ever have the time again to take this work any further. Someone else will have to handle it (hint)...  \n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve added numerous bookmarks to this PDF, which, in the absence of a proper \nindex, or painstaking organizational skills, should make the task of consulting it much easier. There are audio samples of snares recorded at EA studios, included for your convenience. The annex A [equipment list] is available as a separate PDF. \n\nA final note: Some people sell their grandmothers on E-Bay! I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make any \nmoney from this, and neither should you. Share this for free! This was compiled \nfrom the contributions of many people, and I hope they can forgive me for using \ntheir hard work in this way... \n \nWith nothing more to add, I hope you enjoy this release, and start recording!
