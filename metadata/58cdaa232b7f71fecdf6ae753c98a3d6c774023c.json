Grunge Rock bands, Hip-Hop and so on. Music took a trun, a bad one (in my opinion of course). These four records were amongst the handful of albums that were the real deal and big surprise to me. Check them out for yourself. Among these bands, members of The Listening Pool were part of one of the most successful 80s bands. It was founded by three former members of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), after the original line-up split in 1989. The Listening Pool was composed of Paul Humphreys, Malcolm Holmes and Martin Cooper. The style of Still Life is quite a change from the electronic sound of the OMD of old utilizing the individual talents of the members with more acoustic drums, saxophone and keyboards.\n\n\n\nHandful Of Snowdrops - Dans L'Oeil De La Tempete [1991]\n\nListening Pool - Still Life [1994]\n\nMy Life Story - The Golden Mile [1997]\n\nRomania - Remodel [1995]\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58cdaa232b7f71fecdf6ae753c98a3d6c774023c","amp;dn":"Four+90s+Albums+Reminiscent+of+The+80s%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58cdaa232b7f71fecdf6ae753c98a3d6c774023c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,205,170,35,43,127,113,254,205,246,174,117,60,152,163,214,199,116,2,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
