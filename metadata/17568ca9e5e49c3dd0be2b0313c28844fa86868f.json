Wiseblood sounds not unlike its predecessor, Deliverance, with southern rock leanings and crushing Black Sabbathy riffs, but it&amp;#039;s more methodical and deliberate and less adrenaline-hyped overload. The band lets the songs stretch out and breathe, allowing the listener to fully soak in the big rock vibe, without having it furiously hammered home.\n\nEnjoy! :)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17568ca9e5e49c3dd0be2b0313c28844fa86868f","amp;dn":"Corrosion+Of+Conformity+-+Wiseblood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17568ca9e5e49c3dd0be2b0313c28844fa86868f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,86,140,169,229,228,156,61,208,190,43,3,19,194,136,68,250,134,134,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
