Miles Davis was in his prime.  His rhythm section was tight.  And since this was a nightclub appearance, the quintetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s improvisation continues for extended periods.  The tracks vary in length, but most run for ten minutes or more, giving the artists plenty of room to stretch out. \n\nNew technology continues to bring us better sound quality with every release, 24-bit Super Bit Mapping making a huge difference here.  Not even that eveningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s audience can say that they had a better listen.  Balance, tone, and attention to detail keep things at a superior level. \n\nDavis brought a spontaneity to his performances that must have left his audiences in awe.  WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d expect that Paul Chambers would be called upon for a second bass solo during ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that would lead to another round of fours with drummer Jimmy Cobb?  That, of course, turned out to be a run-on into ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBye Bye.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  Davis wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t about to stop the momentum and spoon-feed his audience with narrative comments. \n\nFour of the tracks appearing here have never been issued before, and each of the three sets is presented in its performance order.  Davis is at once familiar and brand new.  ColumbiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new package honors the memory of the master in his prime through this well crafted reissue. &quot;\n\nPersonnel: \nMiles Davis (trumpet)\nHank Mobley (tenor saxophone)\nWynton Kelly (piano)\nPaul Chambers (bass)\nJimmy Cobb (drums)\n\nMiles Davis - In Person Friday Night At The Blackhawk CD 1 of 2 Tracks:\n01  Oleo\n02  No Blues\n03  Bye Bye\n04  If I Were A Bell\n05  Fran Dance\n06  On Green Dolphin Street\n07  The Theme\n\nMiles Davis - In Person Friday Night At The Blackhawk CD 2 of 2 Tracks:\n01  All Of You\n02  Neo\n03  I Thought About You\n04  Bye Bye Blackbird\n05  Walkin'\n06  Love, I've Found You\n\nMiles Davis - In Person Saturday Night At The Blackhawk CD 1 of 2 Tracks:\n01  If I Were A Bell\n02  So What\n03  No Blues\n04  On Green Dolphin Street\n05  Walkin'\n06  'Round Midnight\n07  Well You Needn't\n08  The Theme\n\nMiles Davis - In Person Saturday Night At The Blackhawk CD 2 of 2 Tracks:\n01  Autumn Leaves\n02  Neo\n03  Two Bass Hit\n04  Bye Bye\n05  Love, I've Found You\n06  I Thought About You\n07  Someday My Prince Will Come\n08  Softly As In A Morning Sunrise\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:556519717c5dcc03d45e80a029bde6f41d910226","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+-+In+Person+Saturday+Night+At+The+Blackhawk+CD+2+of+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"556519717c5dcc03d45e80a029bde6f41d910226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,101,25,113,124,93,204,3,212,94,128,160,41,189,230,244,29,145,2,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
