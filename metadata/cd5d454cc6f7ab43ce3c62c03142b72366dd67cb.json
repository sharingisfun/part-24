It is also partly derived from portions of \n\nKamban's Kambaramayanam and other works\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n[ World record ]\n\nAt the time it aired, Ramayan quickly rose to become the most popular program in the history of Indian \n\ntelevision, a title it held until B. R. Chopra's Mahabharat aired, which was after the end of Ramayan's \n\noriginal run. Subsequently, through re-runs and video productions, Ramayan regained popularity and was \n\nlisted in the Limca Book of Records as the world's &quot;most viewed mythological serial&quot; until June 2003\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n[ Cast ]\n\n    Arun Govil     as Ram\n    Deepika        as Sita\n    Sunil Lahri    as Lakshman\n    Sanjay Jog     as Bharat\n    Arvind Trivedi as Ravan\n    Dara Singh     as Hanuman\n    Bal Dhuri      as Dashratha\n    Vijay Arora    as Indrajit\n    Sameer Rajda   as Shatrughna\n    Mulraj Rajda   as Janak\n    Lalita Pawar   as Manthara\n    Jayshree Gadkr as Kaushalya\n    Padma Khanna   as Kaikeyi\n    Rajnibala      as Sumitra\n    Sudhir Dalvi   as Vasishta\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n[Format]\tReligious drama\n\n[Created by]--- Ramanand Sagar\n\n[Country of origin] - India\n\n[Language(s)] - Hindi\n\n[No. of episodes] - 78\n\n[Production Running time] - 35 minutes\n\n[Broadcast Original channel] - Doordarshan\n\n[Original run] January 25, 1987 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ July 31, 1988\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n[Development]\n\nIn 1986, following the moderate success of his television series Vikram aur Betaal and while he was in \n\nthe midst of producing Dada-Dadi Ki Kahaniyan, Ramanand Sagar approached executives at Doordarshan about \n\nthe possibility of producing a serialized version of the Ramayana, of which Sagar was a lifelong \n\ndevotee. The idea was initially rejected, then revived, but delayed due to concerns that such a \n\ntelevision series might lead to a rise in communalism.Finally, the show was indeed approved for 52 \n\nepisodes (which would later be expanded twice in response to the series' overwhelming popularity, each \n\ntime by 13 episodes, bringing the total to 78 episodes), and was given the unpopular time slot of Sunday \n\nmorning at 9:30 a.m.Doordarshan budgeted Sagar Rs. 100,000 per episode\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED  SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd5d454cc6f7ab43ce3c62c03142b72366dd67cb","amp;dn":"Ramayana++-+All+Episodes+-+WITH+ENGLISH+SUBTITALS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd5d454cc6f7ab43ce3c62c03142b72366dd67cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,93,69,76,198,247,171,67,206,60,98,192,49,66,183,35,102,221,103,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
