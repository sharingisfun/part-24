It opens with a consideration of the origins and outcomes of European integration since the Second World War, and how today's EU has been theorized across a range of contemporary disciplines. It then moves to more detailed accounts of political and cultural developments in the three principal states of the original Common MarketÃ¢â‚¬â€France, Germany and Italy. A third section explores the interrelated histories of Cyprus and Turkey that pose a leading geopolitical challenge to the Community. The book ends by tracing ideas of European unity from the Enlightenment to the present, and their bearing on the future of the Union. The New Old World offers a critical portrait of a continent now increasingly hailed as a moral and political example to the world at large.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40fb928ce112343ee2705911ba4848384374ea68","amp;dn":"The+New+Old+World+by+Perry+Anderson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40fb928ce112343ee2705911ba4848384374ea68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,251,146,140,225,18,52,62,226,112,89,17,186,72,72,56,67,116,234,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
