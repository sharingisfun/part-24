Paris - (bonus track) \n\nComing after the relative commercial disappointment of 2002's pop-oriented CRY--and, not at all coincidentally, Gretchen Wilson's rise as the new Everygirl of country--Faith Hill's FIREFLIES is a blatant attempt to ditch the singer's glamourpuss ...    Full Descriptionimage and reassert her country roots, such things having become fashionable again. This isn't a problem, however: Shania Twain-like chart pop wasn't Hill's forte, and FIREFLIES brings her back where she belongs.\n\nThe first single, &quot;Mississippi Girl,&quot; is Hill's best song in years. A Dixie Chicks-like piece of sweet country-pop with a few bluegrass trimmings, the tune was written by country hitmaker John Rich. Rich also penned some of the other standouts here, like the laid-back &quot;Sunshine and Summertime&quot; and &quot;Like We Never Loved At All,&quot; a dramatic, '70s-style duet between Hill and her husband Tim McGraw. Three other songs are from the catalogue of alt-country singer/songwriter Lori McKenna, taking Hill into a folkish vein similar to Mary-Chapin Carpenter. The overall lack of bombast suits Hill's girl-next-door delivery perfectly, making FIREFLIES a much-needed artistic comeback after a dubious detour.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6364b27cfbaeb35d9151706db52be2946e520b55","amp;dn":"Faith+Hill+-+Fireflies+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6364b27cfbaeb35d9151706db52be2946e520b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,100,178,124,251,174,179,93,145,81,112,109,181,43,226,148,110,82,11,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
