Cosy Dens, takes place in the Prague suburbs over the period of time leading to the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia on 21 August 1968. The setting is ideal for a political drama, but Czech artists prefer to make a comedy with political background. The story is told in such a warm, witty and funny way that it reminds us of the golden years of Czech movie making in the 1960s and early 1970s. \n\n\nDVDRip\nRuntime=1:55:57; \nVideo: \nCodec=XviD ISO MPEG-4; Frame Size=720x480; AR=1.500; FPS=25.000; \nBitrate=1533 kb/s; QF=0.177 bpp; B-VOP=[B-VOP]; N-VOP=[]; QPel=[]; GMC=[]; \nAudio: \nCodec=0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3; Streams=1; \nBitrate=136 kb/s VBR [2 channel(s)]; Sample Rate=48000 Hz; \n\nSUBS: English, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0669a56e620c1f7506fe1f3958e58fc1c63ddfab","amp;dn":"Cozy+Dens+%5BJan+Hrebejk%2C+1999%5D+DVDRip+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0669a56e620c1f7506fe1f3958e58fc1c63ddfab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,105,165,110,98,12,31,117,6,254,31,57,88,229,143,193,198,61,223,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
