This show marked Chris KurodaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first absence from the light crew since April 2, 1989 (1,175 shows). Jennifer Hartswick assisted on vocals during Girls, a Jay-Z cover that made its Phish debut. Secret Smile featured a new arrangement. SneakinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Sally contained the closing vocal jam customary to PhishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early versions of the song. That vocal jam led into a brief quote of the Henry Nilsson tune Coconut.  Trey then asked Fishman if he was wearing his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnew suit,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ referring to the Sonic Dress. After Fishman answered ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œno,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Trey went on to rap about how people would have to attend the following night to see Fishman play it. The rap slid into a bit of free-form vocal jamming to close the show.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n04/16/2004 Thomas &amp; Mack Center, Las Vegas, NV\n\nSet 1: Seven Below, Rock and Roll[1] &gt; Boogie On Reggae Woman, Back on the Train -&gt; Possum, Strange Design, Gumbo, Brian and Robert, Taste\n\nSet 2: Gotta Jibboo, Twist, Camel Walk[2] &gt; Wilson -&gt; The Little Drummer Boy &gt; Wilson, Hold Your Head Up &gt; Love You[3] &gt; Hold Your Head Up, Waves &gt; Lifeboy, The Horse &gt; Silent in the Morning, Loving Cup\n\nEncore: Harry Hood\n\n[1] Low Rider teases.\n[2] Wilson teases.\n[3] Fishman on the sonic dress.\n\nNotes: Fenton Williams sat in for Chris Kuroda on lights.

The band played Meatstick seemingly at the instigation of a crowd chant of the lyrics that began behind the stage. Ghost had a Down with Disease tease. YEM included a lengthy Meatstick session immediately following the trampolines segment. As Fishman took a drum solo, Trey set his guitar down to perform the Meatstick Dance while the crowd chanted the lyrics. The band jammed back into YEM, but then left Page to solo while again Trey danced and the crowd sang. This cycle repeated with Mike soloing on bass. YEM lacked its standard vocal jam. Trey rapped: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtime for the MeatstickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ over the intro to Tweezer Reprise, which also had its normal lyrics replaced with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you step into the Meatstick?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ WolfmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contained teases of SneakinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Sally, Possum, Simple, and Meatstick.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:298a0611640c9ba67077f807453cabac553ef840","amp;dn":"Phish+-+LIVE+04%2F15+04%2F16+04%2F17%2F2004+%5B320k+MP3%5D+Las+Vegas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"298a0611640c9ba67077f807453cabac553ef840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,138,6,17,100,12,155,166,112,119,248,7,69,60,171,172,85,62,248,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
