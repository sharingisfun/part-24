Blissfully ignorant, Shane trades in his musician status, full of late nights and fast women, for midnight feedings and lullabies. But when Kate McAlister, his prissy, stuck up caseworker, arrives unexpectedly, he realizes he could lose everything.\n\nKate isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t impressed by ShaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s messy bachelor pad, rocker image, or sexy tattoos. As a matter of fact she finds it all very sophomoric. The sooner sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s off the case the better. Everything from his long hair to his sarcastic attitude threatens her professionalism. But when he lowers his guard and asks for help, she discovers a side to this tattooed musician she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist. Behind this simple man is an unsung hero.\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab4d16d749f368b72b8aed49648b3807752987f","amp;dn":"Simple+Man+by+Lydia+Michaels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ab4d16d749f368b72b8aed49648b3807752987f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,180,209,109,116,159,54,139,114,184,174,212,150,72,179,128,119,82,152,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
