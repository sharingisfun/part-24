With the aid of the school nurse the boy enlists the aid of the U.S. Marines.\n\n\nEarlier I posted the original version of the movie. Here is the newer 1986 example.\n\nHopefully it will give you the chance to see which you prefer.\n\nPersonally I like the older. But the special effects are far better in the newer version.
