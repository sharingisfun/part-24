His friends make fun of him, calling him an Ã¢â‚¬Å“infidelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ because his grandfather Mehmet is an immigrant from Crete. Ozan is afraid of being left alone. He gets angry at his family, especially his grandfather, and he stubbornly challenges his family saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are TurksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nMehmet Bey, OzanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandfather, is a respected shopkeeper in the community. He takes the people of the town under his wings, and helps them with their problems. Mehmet Bey is known for his tolerance and his grandsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attitude not only has him worried but grieves him as well.\n\nMehmet Bey and his family were torn from their land and forced to migrate from Crete during the population exchange when he was just seven years old. Mehmet BeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest desire is to see the land of his birth before he dies. It is this longing that makes him frequently drop bottles containing letters into the turquoise waters of the Aegean.\n\nDEDEMÃ„Â°N Ã„Â°NSANLARI describes the spectacular transformation of a family and their country through the eyes of a ten-year old child and his grandfather living in a small town.\n\n***\n\nVideo: AVC, &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2f674648476f631b011e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;, 1280x544, 1489 kbps, 24 fps\nAudio: AAC, 6 channels, 192 kbps | Turkish\nSize: 1.45 GB (1/3 DVD)\nSub.: English (srt, separate)\nSample: Yes\nSource: 720p BluRay x264-LTRG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85e7cd5432a6be3df68720f4e6aeb81b45e8ff34","amp;dn":"Dedemin+Insanlari+2011+720p+BRRip+x264-EHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85e7cd5432a6be3df68720f4e6aeb81b45e8ff34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,231,205,84,50,166,190,61,246,135,32,244,230,174,184,27,69,232,255,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
