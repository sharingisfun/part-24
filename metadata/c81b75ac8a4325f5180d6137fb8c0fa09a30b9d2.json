But Brown was just the beginning, and Raymond Wolters contends that its best intentions have been taken to unnecessary extremes.\n\nIn this compelling study, a scholar who has long observed the traumas of school desegregation uncovers the changes and difficulties with which public education has dealt over the last fifty yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€and argues that some judicial decisions were ill-advised. Dealing candidly with matters usually considered taboo in academic discourse, Wolters argues that the Supreme Court acted correctly and in accordance with public sentiment in Brown but that it later took a wrong turn by equating desegregation with integration.\n\nRetracing the history of desegregation and integration in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s schools, Wolters distinguishes between several Court decisions, explaining that while Brown called for desegregation by requiring that schools deal with students on a racially nondiscriminatory basis, subsequent decisionsÃ¢â‚¬â€Green, Swann, KeyesÃ¢â‚¬â€required actual integration through racial balancing. He places these decisions in the context of educational reform in the 1950s that sought to encourage bright students through advanced placement and honors coursesÃ¢â‚¬â€courses in which African American and Hispanic students were less likely to be enrolled. Then with the racial unrest of the 1960s, the pursuit of academic excellence yielded to concerns for uplifting disadvantaged youths and ensuring the predominance of middle-class peer groups in schools.\n\nWolters draws on rich historical records to document the devastating consequences of requiring racial balance and sheds new light on AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legal, social, and cultural landscapes. He reexamines the educational theories of Kenneth Clark and James Coleman, and he challenges statistics that support the results of racial balancing by describing how school desegregation and integration actually proceeded in several towns, cities, and counties.\n\nRace and Education is a bold challenge to political correctness in education and a corrective to the now widely accepted notion that desegregation and racially balanced integration are one and the same. It is essential reading for scholars of law and education and a wake-up call for citizens concerned about the future of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s schools.\n\n328 pages\nPublisher: University of Missouri (January 9, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0826218288\nISBN-13: 978-0826218285","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c81b75ac8a4325f5180d6137fb8c0fa09a30b9d2","amp;dn":"Race+and+Education%2C+1954-2007+%282009%29+by+Raymond+Wolters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c81b75ac8a4325f5180d6137fb8c0fa09a30b9d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,27,117,172,138,67,37,245,24,13,97,55,251,140,15,160,154,48,185,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
