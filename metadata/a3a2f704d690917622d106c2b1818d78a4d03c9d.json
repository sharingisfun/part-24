For instance, fast and reliable reading of labels (tags) attached\nto different objects stowed in warehouses can greatly speed up operations\nsuch as localization and retrieval. Among the countless applications, we can cite\npublic transportation and ticketing, access control, production control, animal\nidentification, inventory control, electronic payments, speed-up the checkout in\nshops, location monitoring in real-time of all tagged objects within the supply\nchain, secure operations in dangerous environments, localization of objects (like\ncars in parking lots, or books in libraries), and of people.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3a2f704d690917622d106c2b1818d78a4d03c9d","amp;dn":"Perfect+tag+identification+protocol+in+RFID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3a2f704d690917622d106c2b1818d78a4d03c9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,162,247,4,214,144,145,118,34,209,6,194,177,129,141,120,164,208,60,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
