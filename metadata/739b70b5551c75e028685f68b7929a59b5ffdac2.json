An accomplished songwriter, Brooks wrote every tune here except for one.\n\n\n Obscure but talented tenor saxophonist Tina Brooks is teamed with the young trumpeter Freddie Hubbard (on one of his earliest sessions), pianist Duke Jordan, bassist Sam Jones, and drummer Art Taylor for a set dominated by Brooks' originals. None of the themes may be all that memorable (&quot;Nothing Ever Changes My Love for You&quot; comes the closest), but the hard bop solos are consistently excellent.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Good Old Soul\n 02 - Up Tight's Creek\n 03 - Theme For Doris\n 04 - True Blue\n 05 - Miss Hazel\n 06 - Nothing Ever Changes My Love For You","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:739b70b5551c75e028685f68b7929a59b5ffdac2","amp;dn":"Tina+Brooks+-+True+Blue+%281960%2F2015%29+24bit%2F192khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"739b70b5551c75e028685f68b7929a59b5ffdac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,155,112,181,85,28,117,224,40,104,95,104,183,146,154,89,181,255,218,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
