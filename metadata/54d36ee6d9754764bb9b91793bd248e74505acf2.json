He is widely heralded as one of the greatest scientists of all time.\nHis achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the &quot;father of modern observational astronomy&quot;, the &quot;father of modern physics&quot;, the &quot;father of science&quot;, and &quot;the father of modern science&quot;.\nHis contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter (named the Galilean moons in his honour), and the observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other instruments.\nHere is a collection of 15 books about him as I had promised in my earlier torrent containing &quot;the cambridge companion to Galileo&quot; Also included is the wikipedia article on him.
