This newest edition reflects the clarified auditing standards and the newest PCAOB standards, discusses COSO's updated Internal ControlÃ¢â‚¬â€œIntegrated Framework, integrates discussion of fraud risk throughout the text, and features entirely new and significantly revised end-of-chapter homework problems.\n\n\nFeatures\nEmphasis on Professional Skepticism: This emphasis provides students with the tools to learn how to apply the concept of professional skepticism. The text contains an introduction to this topic in chapter 1, as well as end-of-chapter problems throughout the text to help students see the practical application of this concept.\n\nEmphasis on Professional Judgment: In addition to the focus on professional judgment in the text, interactive exercises emphasize this key auditing skill. This material includes analyses of Ford and Toyota's SEC filings and proxy (Def 14A) materials. Further, the text contains end-of- chapter problems to help ensure student understanding of the link between mandatory financial reporting and auditing, risk assessment, transaction cycles, and analytical procedures.\n\nProfessional Judgment in Context: Each chapter opens with a real-life example from practice that illustrates the judgments involved in auditing. The examples tie to the learning objectives in the chapter, and address important topics such as fraud, regulation, audit quality, and internal control, among others.\nProfessional Decision-Making and Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks: Decision-making frameworks, complete with a chapter-opening Professional Judgment in Context feature, require students to think about a real-life professional and ethical decisions associated with that chapter. End-of-chapter cases continue the use of professional and ethical decision-making frameworks to help students address contemporary issues.\n\nAUDIT OPINION FORMULATION PROCESS: A chapter-opening Audit Opinion Formulation Process figure helps students identify the major steps in the audit process and see how those steps relate to specific chapters within that process.\nAuditing in Practice Features and Chapter Exhibits: Each chapter contains multiple Auditing in Practice features and Exhibits that highlight important, relevant, and practical examples and information related to chapter topics. Selected end-of-chapter problems require students to review these features and exhibits in order to answer related questions.\n\nReal-Life Corporate Exposures to Provide Practical Applications: Ford and Toyota end-of-chapter cases use the actual SEC filings and proxy materials from Ford Motor Company and Toyota Motor Corporation. The individual and group exercises use these real-life corporate disclosures to help students extract the practical applications from the chapter concepts.\n\nGraduate Student Research Analysis Problems: Because academic research yields insights on auditor decisions, the end-of-chapter problems provide at least one problem related to an academic research paper addressing a relevant topic. Each problem requires the student to access an identified research paper, read it, and answer a set of uniform questions tied to the chapter's topics. These activities help students link the topical theory of the chapter with relevant academic research. Academic research articles have been selected that are approachable to students, and yet highlight the complexities in the real practice of auditing. \nThese problems address the recommendation of the recent report from The Pathways Commission to imbed academic research into learning experiences for all accounting students.\nACL Generalized Audit Software With Updated Cases: Version 9 of ACL Desktop Education Edition, the most popular generalized audit software, comes with each new copy of the text. The 9th edition integrates ACL software into homework and cases. A revised ACL Appendix and tutorial is located at the end of the textbook.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n1.
