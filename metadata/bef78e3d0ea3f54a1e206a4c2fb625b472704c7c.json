The film portrays a period in the life of a 19-year-old woman, Malli (Ayesha Dharkar), sent to assassinate a leader in South Asia through a suicide bombing. It stars Dharkar, K. Krishna and Sonu Sisupal. The film is in Tamil. Released in 1998, the film was shot in 15 days, with natural lighting, on a budget of $50,000.\n\nThe film won a number of awards at international film festivals. Actor John Malkovich first saw the film at the 1998 Cairo International Film Festival and subsequently adopted the film as a kind of post-facto executive producer (the reissued film's titles read &quot;John Malkovich Presents&quot;). Critic Roger Ebert has included the film in his series of &quot;Great Movies&quot; reviews. Ebert concludes his review with the following line: &quot;Every time I see the film, I feel a great sadness, that a human imagination could be so limited that it sees its own extinction as a victory.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/theeviravaathi-the-terrorist.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/theeviravaathi-the-terrorist.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage : Tamil\nSubtitles : English (.srt)\n\nIMDB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169302/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169302/&lt;/a&gt;\n7.0/10   1,326 votes \n\n\nPLOT\nMalli is a 19 year old girl, who joined a terrorist organization at a very young age after her brother was killed in the cause. Now in her young adulthood, she volunteers for a suicide assassination mission to kill a VIP in the service of her cause. With intricate preparations and seemingly firm resolve, she makes her way to the target area where the plot will be executed. However, events occur that make her question her determination to complete her mission and the very nature of the sacrifice that she is called upon to make.  \n\n\nREVIEW\n9 out of 10 people found the following review useful:\nAmazing teaching tool, 30 September 2005\n10/10\nAuthor: Cliff Sloane (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;accfdfc0c3cdc2c9ecc2dbc2c9d4d9df82cfc3c1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;) from Seattle, WA\n\nI just finished teaching a course in northern Thailand called &quot;Understanding Cultures Through Cinema.&quot; This movie was the favorite of the class (and I had some great titles in there!). The students were very moved by the movie, and wrote great papers in response. This short line is my favorite example: &quot;I liked (reviewer) because (that reviewer) doesn't say whether a terrorist who wanted to sacrifice her life was right or wrong. When your country is controlled by others, you want to have freedom.&quot; And this from a young sophomore who loves romantic comedies! Talk about a breakthrough!!! Culturally, the students tuned in to some important aspects that don't get noticed: Malli sharing meals with Mr. Vasu, the important moral role played by Lotus/Sorya, and the visual irony of the belt. I gave them a study guide question: How would YOU end this movie? The answers were poignant, and of course, they all mentioned the prevailing motif (which I won't mention here because that would be a spoiler, yes?).\n\nWhen I first saw this movie, I gave it 9. After seeing it several times since, and especially seeing the reaction of my Thai students, I gladly raise it to 10. This is one of my top ten movies of all time. \n\nTECH SPECS\nVideo\nCodec--XVID\nLength--1:35:51\nResolution--608 x 336\nDar--1.810 (38:21)\nFPS--23.976\nBitrate--906\nQF--0.185\n\nAudio\n0x0055 (MP3) 48000Hz  116 kb/s tot (2 chnls) \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-12-25-01h29m08s42.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-12-25-01h29m08s42.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-12-25-01h27m13s158.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-12-25-01h27m13s158.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-12-25-01h26m03s224.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-12-25-01h26m03s224.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
