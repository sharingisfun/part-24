The Prey soundtrack was released in two volumes (nearly 2 hours of the game's 3-hour score). The end credits feature the song &quot;Take Me Home&quot; by After Midnight Project.\nThere are several jukeboxes in the game which allow the player to choose from a small selection of licensed songs. The full selection of songs is, in the order they are arranged:\n&quot;Free Ride&quot; by The Edgar Winter Group;\n&quot;Barracuda&quot; by Heart;\n&quot;You've Got Another Thing Comin'&quot; by Judas Priest;\n&quot;Cat Scratch Fever&quot; by Ted Nugent;\n&quot;If We Could Be&quot; by Railer;\n&quot;Deaf Girlfriend&quot; by Scotch Greens;\n&quot;Settle Up&quot; by Seven Mary Three;\n&quot;Machine Sex&quot; by Sheep on Drugs;\n&quot;Anthem for Tonight&quot; by Halifax;\n&quot;Human Resources&quot; by The Countdown;\n&quot;Forever Dead&quot; by Soil;\n&quot;10001110101&quot; by Clutch;\n&quot;The Setting Sun&quot; by MxPx (commissioned specifically for the game)\n&quot;(Don't Fear) The Reaper&quot; by Blue ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œyster Cult. This song cYearst be chosen normally, but plays on the jukebox during the alien invasion in the same level.\nIn addition, radio host Art Bell lends his voice to several fictional segments of his paranormal-themed radio show, Coast to Coast AM, that play from radios throughout the game. In the segments, he talks with many callers about the various alien phenomena that occur in the game.\n\n** Other informations TECNICI **\n\n[code]General\nComplete name                    : E:\\Musica\\MIXTUS\\Videogiochi O.S.T\\Prey Volume 1 e Volume 2\\Volume 1\\01 - Prey Overture.mp3\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFile size                        : 13.2 MiB\nDuration                         : 5mn 47s\nOverall bit rate                 : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                            : Prey Soundtrack - Volume 1\nTrack name                       : Prey Overture\nTrack name/Position              : 01\nPerformer                        : Jeremy Soule &amp; Julian Soule\nAccompaniment                    : Jeremy Soule &amp; Julian Soule\nComposer                         : Jeremy Soule &amp; Julian Soule\nGenre                            : Soundtrack\nRecorded date                    : 2006\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97 \nCopyright                        : Artistry Entertainment, Inc.\nURL                              : www.artistryentertainment.com\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nDuration                         : 5mn 47s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 13.2 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97 \nEncoding settings                : -m s -V 4 -q 0 -lowpass 16.5[/code]\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5331d30106ce51c271fbf4308a8f4c4dcc123685","amp;dn":"Prey+OST+%5BLossy+Mp3+320+Kbit%5D+%5BTNTVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5331d30106ce51c271fbf4308a8f4c4dcc123685","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,49,211,1,6,206,81,194,113,251,244,48,138,143,76,77,204,18,54,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
