DJ Rob Dinero had to literally recreate every beat from scratch.\n\nWe think the project is dope and we highly recommend giving it a spin.\n\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nDJ Rob Dinero Presents:\n\nThe Notorious B.I.G. &amp; 2Pac\n\n&quot;Watching Over The Throne&quot;\n\n01 Intro {WoTT}\n02 No Church In The Wild Feat.
