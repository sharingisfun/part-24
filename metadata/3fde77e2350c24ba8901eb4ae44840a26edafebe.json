I used to work as an audio mastering engineer in the music industry for almost 20 years. Now my health is not so good &amp; i'm disabled &amp; retired.  This gives me the time to work on projects like this one...as long as my health is decent.  I wish to remain anonymous for any possible legal issues regarding bootlegs...ya never know in today's world:-(   I treat each track as if they were final mixes placed on my desk to be mastered.  I only deal with high quality recorded &amp; mixed tracks...stuff I'm gonna listen to myself after they are mastered. On to this series of tracks.\n\nFirst, I chose only tracks that were recorded &amp; mixed somewhat pretty good (except for the 2 Bonus songs...i couldn't resist adding them even though they have their share of hiccups &amp; the quality of recording is not up to par). I did some edits (removed clicks, crackle, hiss, corrected speed/pitch, fades...etc.), then went about the mastering procces. I tried hard to stay away from compressing the mids &amp; was real careful not to limit them to death so as to keep the dynamics/transients intact. They are limited to around 12.3db--15db, which is a good comprimise between loudness &amp; dynamics. Don't expect them to sound like officially released tracks...although i do prefer some of these over their official counterpart. Some tracks were just not recorded good enough (wild horses, sweet virginia, all down the down_acoustic...etc.), but still sound pretty good. The songs are in no particular order, i figure you can make your own cd's with the tracks you like best. Check out the samples in the mp3(320kbps) sample file.  My deepest gratitude goes out to all who have shared/uploaded these gems...you know who you are!\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01 - Brown Sugar (altered Mick Taylor version COTHSBurlesque)\n02 - Jiving Sister Fanny (Itchy Fingers-IU)\n03 - Good Time Women (Exile Outtakes)\n04 - I'm Going Down (Itchy Fingers-IU)\n05 - Shine A Light (Lost Sessions EVSD 332)\n06 - Dance Little Sister (Extended Mix) (USMasters)\n07 - Criss-Cross Man - (AGNTTW_GHSoup)\n08 - Dead Flowers (Acoustic Version - Sotheby Reel)\n09 - Stop Breaking Down (Best of Exile Sessions)\n10 - Dear Doctor (Unplugged-IU)\n11 - Memo From Turner I (ORSessions-IU)\n12 - Family (Trident)\n13 - Fiji Jim (Accidents)\n14 - Do You Think I Really Care aka Yellow Cab (Accidents)\n15 - Drift Away (AGNTTW_GHSoup)\n16 - Downtown Suzie [take II] (Black Box CD2)\n17 - Travelling Man (IORnR--IU)\n18 - You Got The Silver (Unplugged-IU)\n19 - Living In The Heart Of Love (IORnR-IU)\n20 - I Ain't Lying (Best of Exile Sessions)\n21 - I Don't Know Why (Itchy Fingers-IU)\n22 - Sister Morphine (Unplugged-IU)\n23 - Get A Line On You (Sotheby Reel)\n24 - All Down The Line II (Itchy Fingers-IU)\n25 - Brown Sugar (1969 Shot Of Salvation)\n26 - Let The Good Times Roll (Necrophilia)\n27 - Child Of The Moon (Session Impossible MUCD 027)\n28 - You Can't Always Get What You Want (Unplugged-IU)\n29 - Wild Horses (Unplugged-IU)\n30 - Too Many Cooks (1973 MJ Single--Shot Of Salvation)\n31 - Pay Your Dues (Early SFMan) (Necrophilia)\n32 - Memo From Turner II (ORSessions-IU)\n33 - Parachute Woman (Alternate Mix) (USMasters)\n34 - Family (Retake) (Trident)\n35 - All Down The Down_Acoustic (MYTPHOuttakes)\n36 - Stuck Out All Alone (aka Give Me A Hamburger) (Trident)\n37 - Everything's Turning To Gold (COTHSBurlesque)\n38 - Sweet Virginia (USMasters)\n39 - Cocksucker Blues II (Cocksucker Blues)\n40 - If You Can't Rock Me (USMasters)\n\n\nBONUS TRACKS:\n\n41 - Brown Sugar (w Eric Clapton 1969) (Itchy Fingers-IU)\n42 - I Don't Know The Reason Why (Itchy Fingers-IU)\n43 - Sympathy For The Devil (COTHSBurlesque)\n\n\nSOURCES Used in this compilation:\n\nShot Of Salvation (Scorpio OM 90-64-17)\nAccidents Will Happen Outtakes 1966-1978 (VGP 370)\nAin't Got No Time To Waste - Goats Head Soup &amp; More\nBest Of The Exile Outtakes (Uploaded at HungerCity)\nExile Outtakes - I Gave You Diamonds, You Give Me Disease \n   (Sister Morphine CD-015)\nThe Creme Of The Hot Stuff AKA You Can Always Get What You Want\n   (Burlesque Music-1997)\nItchy Fingers Studio Outtakes 1969-1972 (Invasion Unlimited IU 9535-1)\nOlympic Recording Sessions 1968-1969 (Invasion Unlimited IU9534-1)\nUnplugged (Invasion Unlimited IU 9542-1 / 1995)\nSOTHEBY'S REEL 1969-1970 (Idol Mind Production / IMP-N-013)\nThe Trident Mixes (Dog n Cat CD689)\nIt's Only Rock &amp; Roll Outtakes (Invasion Unlimited IU9536-1)\nCocksucker Blues\nSession Impossible Vol. 1 (MUCD 027)\nNecrophilia (London/ABKCO Records - rare unreleased 1972 album)\nLost Sessions Vol. 1 (Empress Valley Supreme Disc EVSD 332)\nMasons Yard To Primrose Hill Outtakes 1964-1970 (VGP 112)\nBlack Box CD2 (Yellow Dog)\nTime Trip Vol. 1-5 (Scorpio??)\nUnsurpassed Masters Vol. 1 - 7\n\n\nPlease upload this to other sites, but keep the files unchanged so myself &amp; others can help seed it (less chance this will be sold for money...which i strongly don't want to happen...DO NOT SELL).
