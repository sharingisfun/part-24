In Schwartz&amp;#039;s estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied.\nBarry Schwartz studies the relationship between economics and psychology, delivering startling insights into modern life. His latest book, The Paradox of Choice, argues that the abundance of choice in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s western world leads not to happiness but psychological distress.\n\nIn his 2004 book The Paradox of Choice , Barry Schwartz tackles one of the great mysteries of modern life: Why is it that societies of great abundance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where individuals are offered more freedom and choice (personal, professional, material) than ever before ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are now witnessing a near-epidemic of depression? Conventional wisdom tells us that greater choice is for the greater good, but Schwartz argues the opposite: He makes a compelling case that the abundance of choice in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s western world is actually making us miserable.\n\nInfinite choice is paralyzing, Schwartz argues, and exhausting to the human psyche. It leads us to set unreasonably high expectations, question our choices before we even make them and blame our failures entirely on ourselves. His relatable examples, from consumer products (jeans, TVs, salad dressings) to lifestyle choices (where to live, what job to take, who and when to marry), underscore this central point: Too much choice undermines happiness.\n\nSchwartzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s previous research has addressed morality, decision-making and the varied inter-relationships between science and society. Before Paradox he published The Costs of Living, which traces the impact of free-market thinking on the explosion of consumerism -- and the effect of the new capitalism on social and cultural institutions that once operated above the market, such as medicine, sports, and the law.\n\nBoth books level serious criticism of modern western society, illuminating the under-reported psychological plagues of our time. But they also offer concrete ideas on addressing the problems, from a personal and societal level.\n\n    &quot;Whether choosing a health-care plan, choosing a college class or even buying a pair of jeans, Schwartz shows that a bewildering array of choices floods our exhausted brains, ultimately restricting instead of freeing us.&quot;\n\nPublisherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Weekly\n\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\n\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\n\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\n\nAre you a British citizen?
