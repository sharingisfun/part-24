Ready to print and play!\n\nAlso included is a blank template (.PSD so you can choose which cards to print) and a deck box (To keep your cards in).\n\n\n\n[Tips for printing]\n\n- Print onto thick (220+ GSM) high quality photo paper (Semi-Glossy/Satin), others will work but I've found these to work best.\n\n- Make sure you print from within a program which allows to print to scale (No resizing) as these are already the correct size when printed.\n\n- DO NOT print in greyscale as the camera will not pickup the bar codes and green orientation triangles.\n\n\n\nHUGE shame Sony/Wizards of the Coast stopped supporting this, but it's really the only way to play now as the cards are almost impossible to get hold of!\n\nSet 2&amp;3 are available as DLC on the US Playstation store for $19.99, the European store no longer has the download. Anyone outside of the US will need to get a NTSC copy of the game and download the US DLC to use it. The PAL version WILL NOT work with the US DLC.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04242f00d3601fe5667dcdf0704f42a17fc0abf6","amp;dn":"PS3+The+Eye+of+Judgment+Card+Scans+Plus+Bonus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04242f00d3601fe5667dcdf0704f42a17fc0abf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,36,47,0,211,96,31,229,102,125,205,240,112,79,66,161,127,192,171,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
