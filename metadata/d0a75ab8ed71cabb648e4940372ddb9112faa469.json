Most cracks are the result of solidification, cooling and stresses that develop due to weld shrinkage. Weld cracking can lead to structural failures which at best will require remedial action and at worst can lead to loss of life. All industries that utilize welding can be affected, including nuclear, aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding and civil engineering. This book covers the processes of weld cracking in different ferrous alloys and for different welding technologies. It also covers methods of testing for weld cracks, avoidance and repair.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 384 pages\n# Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (December 24, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1420079638\n# ISBN-13: 978-1420079630","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0a75ab8ed71cabb648e4940372ddb9112faa469","amp;dn":"Weld+Cracking+in+Ferrous+Alloys%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0a75ab8ed71cabb648e4940372ddb9112faa469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,167,90,184,237,113,202,187,100,142,73,64,55,45,219,145,18,250,164,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
