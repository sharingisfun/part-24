Their ghosts return to their beloved Victorian home, and find the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, which not only lets them know they're dead, but comes in handy when they learn that they can continue to live in their house, even though a new familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from the land of the livingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is moving in. The new owners, fresh from the city, are quite a strange group themselves, and include the overpowering hipster mom Delia (Catherine O'Hara), her pompous SoHo interior designer Otho (Glenn Shadix), her meek husband Charles (Jeffrey Jones), and their morose teenage daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder), who befriends the ghostly couple. Though the threesome attempt to scare Delia from ruining the house with redecoration and her unpleasant personality, their attempts fail. As a last resort, they call upon the services of the demented, terrifying, but hilarious &quot;bioexorcist,&quot; &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (Michael Keaton).\n\nGenre: Comedy, Fantasy\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c51382c96db4947217fdbc7cfe189ce6dd6bab26","amp;dn":"Beetlejuice.1080p.AC+3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ra+y.PS3-TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c51382c96db4947217fdbc7cfe189ce6dd6bab26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,19,130,201,109,180,148,114,23,253,188,124,254,24,156,230,221,107,171,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
