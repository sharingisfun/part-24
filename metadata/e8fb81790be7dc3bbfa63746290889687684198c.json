Originally a tape (maybe 500 produced in total), extremely rare (try finding it yourself if you don't believe me) with just a few known cassettes still in existence and some tracks on Youtube.  Consisted of seven (7) songs, including &quot;Silent Goodbye&quot; dedicated to their friend, Brandon Wantland, who died in a car accident.\n\nTracks Include:\n\n01. Consider\n02. Walk Through the Door\n03. You're The Reason\n04. Hillbilly Rock\n05. Screwdriver\n06. Sad\n07. Silent Goodbye\n\nAlso includes cover and original back cover of cassette case *[picture pulled from listing of a copy that was on sale on eBay]\n\nDid my best to clean up the audio, MUCH better then the original sound files I had got my hands on.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for further improving the audio, please let me know.\n\nSUPER RARE!  PLEASE SEED!\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8fb81790be7dc3bbfa63746290889687684198c","amp;dn":"Blind+Thought+-+Alternative+Roads+%5BBrent+Smith%5D+%28early+90%27s%29+-+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8fb81790be7dc3bbfa63746290889687684198c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,251,129,121,11,231,220,59,191,166,55,70,41,8,137,104,118,132,25,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
