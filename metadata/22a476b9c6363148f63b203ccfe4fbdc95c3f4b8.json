Fresh is the stage name of Douglas E. Davis (born September 17, 1966), an American rapper, record producer, and beatboxerÃƒÂ¢??he&amp;#039;s also known as &quot;The Human Beatbox.&quot; One of the earliest recorded beatboxers, Fresh is able to accurately imitate drum machines and various special effects using only his mouth.\n\n\nBorn in Barbados,[1] Doug E. Fresh moved to the United States with his family when he was young.\n\nHe made his recording debut in 1983, as part of the Boo-Dah Bliss Crew (with Spoonie Gee and DJ Spivey) on the Top Flight Records single &quot;Pass the Boo-Dah&quot;. He gained greater recognition the following yearÃƒÂ¢??appearing in Beat Street, backing the Treacherous Three. Later that same year, Fresh released his first records as a solo artist: &quot;Just Having Fun&quot; and &quot;Original Human Beatbox&quot;.\n\nHis 1985 single &quot;The Show&quot; (which borrows the melody of the Inspector Gadget theme),[2] and its B-side, &quot;La Di Da Di,&quot; are considered early hip hop classics. The single featured the &quot;Get Fresh Crew&quot;: DJs Barry B. and Chill Will, and MC Ricky D (who would later achieve fame as Slick Rick).\n\nIn 1986, Doug E. Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew released their debut full-length album, Oh, My God!. It included such notable tracks as &quot;Play This Only at Night&quot; and &quot;All the Way to Heaven&quot;, and was critically hailed for incorporating elements of reggae and gospel music. The next year saw another album, The World&amp;#039;s Greatest Entertainer, which appeared on Billboard magazine&amp;#039;s charts, due in part to the popular single, &quot;Keep Risin&amp;#039; to the Top&quot;. MC Ricky D&amp;#039;s input was not appreciated by the record label, Fantasy Records, and he was asked to leave the group. (Rick&amp;#039;s 1989 solo debut, The Great Adventures of Slick Rick brought the MC greater success than he had attained as part of the Get Fresh Crew, reaching #1 on the Billboard R&amp;B/Hip Hop charts.)\n\nIn 1989, Fresh recorded the song &quot;Spirit&quot; for the film Ghostbusters II soundtrack.\n\nFresh did not record again until 1992&amp;#039;s Doin&amp;#039; What I Gotta Do, issued by MC Hammer&amp;#039;s Bust It Records. Fresh also beatboxed the drumline for the song &quot;Freaks&quot;, by child reggae artist Lil&amp;#039; Vicious. Fresh also appeared in the video.\n\nIn 1995, Slick Rick and Fresh reunited for a record entitled Play which found Fresh back on his feet. Play received positive reviews; Bret Love writes that the record is &quot;a welcome flashback to the days when guns, drugs, sex and violence were not the genre&amp;#039;s primary lyrical focus.&quot;[3]\n\nIn the late 1990s, Fresh collaborated with Prince on a number of recordings, notably Newpower Soul and the 1999, the New Master EP. Recently, Fresh has appeared on VH1&amp;#039;s I Love the 80s and on March 29, 2007 he appeared on Nickelodeon&amp;#039;s ME:TV for Beatbox Week.\n\nFresh recorded the current theme used for the New York Knicks, in their highlight videos and during the pregame warm-up&amp;#039;s, titled Take Me Home, based very much off of the John Denver hit Take Me Home, Country Roads in 2001.\n\nFresh also made a few Drum and Bass tracks in collaboration with E-Z Rollers in 2003, the best well-known being &quot;Rhyme &amp; Punishment&quot;.\n\nIn 2004 (October 9) (Oc, Fresh performed onstage with the Beastie Boys in Madison Square Garden. The performance was captured on video for the 2006 in-concert movie Awesome; I Fuckin&amp;#039; Shot That!.\n\nOn May 23, 2007, Fresh performed variations upon &quot;The Show&quot; with finalist Blake Lewis on the season six finale of American Idol, the first ever hip-hop performance on the show,[citation needed] which was watched by over 200 million people around the world.[citation needed]\n\nFresh is often called upon to host events for Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs, Bill Clinton and many other high profile celebrities.[citation needed]\n\nHe currently resides in Central Harlem with his 5 sons. Two of his sons are in a rap group called &quot;Square Off&quot; and are featured on Fresh&amp;#039;s recently released single &quot;Left-Right&quot;.\n\n\n\nTracks\n\nGuess Who?\nEverybody Got 2 Get Some\nD.E.F. = Doug E.
