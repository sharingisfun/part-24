He falls for Mallinson's daughter, Dorothy (Barbara Rush) and decides to work for crooked fight promoter Harry Cram to earn the money to keep her in the style to which she has become accustomed.\n\nThe movie was Murphy's first following the tremendous box office success of To Hell and Back (1955) and used the same producer and director as that film. Murphy fights with several real life boxers on screen, including Chico Vejar, Art Aragon and Cisco Andrade.[2][3] Andrade later praised Murphy as being &quot;the first actor I ever saw who wasn't afraid of getting hit hard in a prize fight scene.&quot; According to Murphy's biographer, the film &quot;didn't do anything at the box office&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a6685341ed9f2dc8d61bac458b8778c70962376","amp;dn":"World+In+My+Corner+%5BAudie+Murphy%5D+%281956%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a6685341ed9f2dc8d61bac458b8778c70962376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,102,133,52,30,217,242,220,141,97,186,196,88,184,119,140,112,150,35,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
