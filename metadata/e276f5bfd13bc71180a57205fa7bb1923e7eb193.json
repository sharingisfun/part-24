Born in Suffolk, he is known principally for his landscape paintings of Dedham Vale, the area surrounding his homeÃ¢â‚¬â€now known as &quot;Constable Country&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€which he invested with an intensity of affection. &quot;I should paint my own places best&quot;, he wrote to his friend John Fisher in 1821, &quot;painting is but another word for feeling&quot;.\n\nIn ConstableÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time England was divided into thirty-nine counties. Constable set foot in just over half of them; he never crossed the borders into Wales or Scotland, still less did he travel out of the country, even when his pictures were creating a furor in Paris in 1824. The scenes that enter significantly into his painting are drawn from an even more restricted area: the six counties of Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, Wiltshire, Dorset, and Sussex. Geographically, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ConstableÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s EnglandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a severely limited concept. In his concentration on a small number of places studied over and over again Constable presents a sharp contrast with his great contemporary Turner, who took not only England, Scotland, and Wales but also the whole of accessible Europe as his province.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e276f5bfd13bc71180a57205fa7bb1923e7eb193","amp;dn":"Constables+England+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e276f5bfd13bc71180a57205fa7bb1923e7eb193","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,118,245,191,209,59,199,17,128,165,114,5,250,123,177,146,62,126,177,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
