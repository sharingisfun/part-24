For him, the law is rarely about guilt or innocence--it&amp;#039;s about negotiation and manipulation.  Sometimes it&amp;#039;s even about justice.\n\nA Beverly Hills playboy arrested for attacking a woman hires Haller, and Mickey has his first high-paying client in years.  It&amp;#039;s a defense attorney&amp;#039;s dream, and Haller starts to believe it is the easiest case of his career.\n\nThen someone close to him is murdered and Haller finds that his search for innocence has brought him face-to-face with pure evil.  Now he must deploy every tactic, feint, and instinct in his arsenal to walk away alive.\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer is a display of novelistic mastery--as gripping and whiplash-surprising as any novel yet from the write Publishers Weekly has called &quot;today&amp;#039;s Dostoyevsky of crime literature.&quot;\n\nUnabridged and narrated by Adam Grupper.\n\nEnjoy the book!\n\nRipley5by5\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3226d8a820f6f641c90d5ed02ecd698afefe1926","amp;dn":"Lincoln+Lawyer+-+Michael+Connelly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3226d8a820f6f641c90d5ed02ecd698afefe1926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,38,216,168,32,246,246,65,201,13,94,208,46,205,105,138,254,254,25,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
