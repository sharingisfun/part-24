The trio employs fiddle, acoustic guitar, banjo, and--yes--jug, for a sound that's full of reverence for first-generation string-band music but breathes with plenty of sonic vitality. Unsurprisingly, there are traditional tunes aplenty on the band's debut album, DONA GOT A RAMBLIN' MIND, and the Chocolate Drops tear into them with the same reckless abandon that made their musical heroes' music so immediately appealing so many years earlier.\n\nThe Carolina Chocolate Drops: Rhiannon Giddens, Dom Flemons, Justin Robinson (banjo).\n\nAdditional personnel: Sule Greg Wilson (percussion).\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:372e154524a26becad09d2723ee9712db735bbd7","amp;dn":"Carolina+Chocolate+Drops...Dona+Got+A+Ramblin%5C%27+Mind%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"372e154524a26becad09d2723ee9712db735bbd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,46,21,69,36,162,107,236,173,9,210,114,62,233,113,45,183,53,187,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
