The productions were broadcast live to cinemas on 14 May and 18 June 2014 respectively.\r\n\r\n   Henry IV ... is a tale of power, treachery and war, exploring the complexity of father-son relationships. \r\n\r\n   This rip includes subtitles in English, French and German.\r\n\r\n  My notes\r\n\r\n  For comparison my fileshares also includes the Globe On Screen production of the Henry plays by Shakespeare.  They have a completely different look and I leave it up to the viewer as to which they like better, if a choice needs to be made.\r\n\r\n  A note about Anthony Sher in the lead role.  He can also be seen in my fileshare of the RSC production of &quot;Tartuffe&quot; as a much younger man.  Sir Anthony is one of the great treasures of the British theatre and no less in this Henry production.\r\n\r\n  As always,  I encourage viewers to see these fileshares as a way to purchase the RSC dvds for their libraries.  The scenography is excellent and provides a glimpse into what scenography contributes to the play.\r\n\r\nNotes written October 17th  2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02894fdd4dc17ff9fb07a704b29e8cee79bdf361","amp;dn":"RSC+Henry+IV+Part+One+by+Wm+Shakespeare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02894fdd4dc17ff9fb07a704b29e8cee79bdf361","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,137,79,221,77,193,127,249,251,7,167,4,178,158,140,238,121,189,243,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
