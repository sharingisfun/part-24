There are some great songs in here, some examples, the guitar of Chris Cacavas ex member of Green on Red. \nAn explicit cover of Fire of Arthur Brown by the german Die Krupps in which is featuring Arthur Brown himself 30 years after the original song. There's a cover of the Beatles by the australian Sacred Cowboys, the psychedelic &quot;I am the walrus&quot;, the Flleshtones cover the most well known song of the canadian Guess Who, the song called &quot;american woman&quot; and the underground avant-gardish Residents give their usually unusuall touch interpratating the &quot;Jailhouse rock&quot; writen by Lieber/Stoller (see the Coasters) but known of course from Elvis Preslay. \nThere also The Dream Syndicate -part of the l.a. based Paisley Undergrounnd scene- with the song called &quot;Boston&quot;, a song talking about the days of the mid/late '60s of Van Morrison who lived there, and also for a great finale a song full of sarcasm and clever humour by mr Frank Zappa, oh yeah, the song its called &quot;titties 'n beer&quot;.... \nBut don't remain only on these names, I gurantee you a good trip through these 16 tracks. \nI pass the word on the magazine's booklet: \n&quot;If with the term 'new rock' we mean something youthful, full of sweat, adrenaline, pathos, angry or lo-fi but always dominating guitars then the cd &quot;New rock, sound therapy&quot; its an essential attempt to note some of the so many musical styles of a music that is talking to listeners with open ears and most of all, open mind [...]&quot;.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/4923/foldertfm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/4923/foldertfm.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n01.
