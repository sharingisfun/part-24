Jane Milton doesn't want to sell her beloved beach hut, which has been the heart of so many family holidays and holds so many happy memories. But when her husband dies, leaving her with an overwhelming string of debts, she has no choice but to sell. THE BEACH HUT follows the stories of the people who own the beach huts, families who come to Everdene each year, people who fall in - or out of - love, remembering their pasts, or trying to forget them... Veronica Henry has brilliantly drawn together the comings and goings of life at the beach huts over one long, hot, lazy summer...\n\nIt's the start of a long hot summer and once again the beach huts are home for the people who return each year ...\n\nThere's Jane, left only debts by her husband, and forced to sell the beloved beach hut which holds so many happy memories; Sarah, for whom fidelity has lost its appeal; and Harry, suffering from all the anguish of first love when he falls for Florence - who has grown up to be far more alluring than she ever used to be.\nTHE BEACH HUT follows the stories of the families who come to Everdene each year, people who fall in - or out - of love, remembering their pasts, or trying to forget them...\n\nThis is a multi-tracker torrent.
