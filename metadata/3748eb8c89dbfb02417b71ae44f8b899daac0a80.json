Named wholly after types of birds and bearing the title The Bird School of Being Human, we instinctively assume that this fledgling has fallen straight from the nest, prey to any passing predator, but Williams is as deceptive as the title of her up-coming single and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no stranger to the scene. With sly foresight, her discography begins with the mockingly titled EP Fledgling released in 2009 and her diary is filled with headline tours, overseas festivals and more than her fair share of independent radio play. Although only now making her presence felt here at home, over the last two years she has amassed a remarkable experience overseas.\n\nHer soon to be released single Ã¢â‚¬Å“SparrowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which is already available to view on Youtube, is a fantastic example of the diversity on display here. Diversity in every sense of the word. Williams successfully juxtaposes cribbed Dolly Parton lyrics with references to Chairman MaoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Great Sparrow Massacre campaign, distorted, dissonant sounds with harps and passionately expressed lyrics following a vocal and lyrical style of acidic honesty. Comparisons could be made to CocoRosie, Joanna Newsom, Katie Jane Garside even but only in the sense that her voice, as it soars and dips on apparently fragile wings is a wonderfully strong and individual instrument. Her lyrics, always unexpected, pertinent, shocking even in their examination of subjects few artists dare to address make this album and Ã¢â‚¬Å“SparrowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in particular a fierce creature indeed.\n\nHer opening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red KiteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, for all its surface gentility is not a gentle introduction to what follows, the one track lacking in underlying and intertwined distortion, even the soothing sound of WilliamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harp and wavering voice cannot hide the underlying savagery of her lyrics, romantically describing an instance of domestic violence in such a way as to leave the listener unsure of their reaction, but moved by it certainly. The track concludes with the destructive distorted sounds which build from track to track as her voice gains strength and intensity. This rise reaches its crescendo in the track Ã¢â‚¬Å“CrowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which brings in to play a horn and several other effects to create the perfect breakdown. Williams almost mutters her opening lyrics to herself, with a mad intensity. The cacophony of background sounds has the listener leaning forward to catch her words which are undoubtedly the most brilliant and beautiful of the album, until the song reaches its peak and Williams chants and speaks in such a way as to suggest a long dead, long-forgotten voice, recorded and replayed a thousand times, until the meaning of the words is lost.\n\nThe song, indeed, the album, is nothing less than otherworldly and undoubtedly brilliant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3748eb8c89dbfb02417b71ae44f8b899daac0a80","amp;dn":"Woodpecker+Wooliams+-+The+Bird+School+of+Being+Human+%5B2012%5D%5BFLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3748eb8c89dbfb02417b71ae44f8b899daac0a80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,72,235,140,137,219,251,2,65,123,113,174,68,248,184,153,218,172,10,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
