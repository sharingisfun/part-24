Nollet, Fidel ToldrÃ¡ (CRC, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4398-3085-7\r\n\r\nFor food scientists, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a powerful tool for product composition testing and assuring product quality. Since the last edition of this volume was published, great strides have been made in HPLC analysis techniquesâ€”with particular attention given to miniaturization, automatization, and green chemistry. Thoroughly updated and revised, Food Analysis by HPLC, Third Edition offers practical and immediately applicable information on all major topics of food components analyzable by HPLC.\r\n\r\nMaintaining the rigorous standards that made the previous editions so successful and lauded by food scientists worldwide, this third edition examines:\r\n\r\nRecent trends in HPLC\r\nHPLC separation techniques for amino acids, peptides, proteins, neutral lipids, phospholipids, carbohydrates, alcohols, vitamins, and organic acids\r\nHPLC analysis techniques for sweeteners, colorants, preservatives, and antioxidants\r\nHPLC determinations of residues of mycotoxins, antimicrobials, carbamates, organochlorines, organophosphates, herbicides, fungicides, and nitrosamines\r\nHPLC determinations of residues of growth promoters, endocrine disrupting chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins\r\nHPLC applications for the analysis of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, betalains, organic bases, anions, and cations\r\n\r\nPresenting specific and practical applications to food chemistry, the contributors provide detailed and systematic instructions on sample preparation and separation conditions. The book is an essential reference for those in the fields of chromatography, analytical chemistry, and, especially, food chemistry and food technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:290dc5041468a8fd4152c913656ce57647547a2c","amp;dn":"Food+Analysis+by+HPLC+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"290dc5041468a8fd4152c913656ce57647547a2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,13,197,4,20,104,168,253,65,82,201,19,101,108,229,118,71,84,122,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
