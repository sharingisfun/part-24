These are direct copies of the boxset dvds so the quality is as good as it gets. After you burn them please keep the files on you computer for upload for a while. \n\nYou will also need a program that can burn ISOs. There are a few free ones around, if you are using windows xp I recommend CDBurnerXP. If you don't want/can't burn them, you'll need a program that can pretend the ISOs are actual dvds and play them. Google &quot;virtual dvd player&quot; and look for a free one for your operating system.\n\nGuys - I pay for uploads and my speed is poor. I will try to max it out and get this up but once I do I can't afford to keep seeding on my own. As I'm a student &amp; my uploads aren't cheap, I'll throttle it after I've upped it and then I will be trusting you guys to keep it going. Don't let me down :) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a46cd1a90be0a03b0f8382482d1d92df43dad68","amp;dn":"Red+Dwarf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a46cd1a90be0a03b0f8382482d1d92df43dad68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,70,205,26,144,190,10,3,176,248,56,36,130,209,217,45,244,61,173,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
