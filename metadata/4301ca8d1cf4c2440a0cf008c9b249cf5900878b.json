Disk images pack entire folders or disks into a single compressed file, either for transport across the Internet or simply for backup. They are Apple's preferred format for distributing Mac software. Disk images are also the only archive format whose contents you can directly access in the Finder.\n\nDropDMG is the easiest way to create Mac OS X disk images, as well as cross-platform archives. Just drag and drop a folder or file and you're done. Or, you can drag an existing disk image or archive onto DropDMG to convert it to any of the other supported formats or to burn it to CD or DVD.\n\nDropDMG supports advanced options such as encrypted and segmented disk images, WYSIWYG layout with background pictures and custom volume icons, and rich-text license agreements in multiple languages. There are many time-saving features, and it can also be automated via AppleScript, the command-line, and Automator.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* Fixed a bug where DropDMG sometimes didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t create large enough\n  disk images for files that were stored using HFS+ compression (e.g.\n  applications from the Mac App Store).\n\n* Fixed a bug where the log showed the source folderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s allocated size\n  rather than its logical size.\n\n* Fixed a bug creating a disk image with a layout that had text but no \n  background picture.\n\n* Fixed a bug that could cause DropDMG to create a device image with a\n  dirty HFS+ journal. If the disk image was read-only, it would not be \n  possible to mount the disk image. If you have such a disk image, you \n  can fix it by converting it to a read-write format. The journal will then be \n  replayed and saved in a clean state.\n\n* Fixed a bug where DropDMG could hang when using the contextual \n  menu in the log.\n\n* Added instructions for burning a disc with a Custom volume icon.\n\n* Updated the Italian localization.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel or PPC Mac \n\nOS version: Mac OS X.5.8 or above\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---Official Web Site: &lt;a href=&quot; http://c-command.com/dropdmg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://c-command.com/dropdmg/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPatcher courtesy of Special [K]\n\nDropDMG...
