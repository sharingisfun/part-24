Each of the victims have been killed with a simple pin stuck into a cyst they each had behind their left ears. The investigation takes them to corruption and secrets that have been kept for centuries.\n\nThe world is not as they had thought. There is a grand conspiracy that began ages ago and has taken control of almost the entire world. One of the things it does not control are a brother and sister, the Raptors, who have decided that the kingdom of the conspiracy must come to an end. The more they learn about the truth, the more danger they are in.\n\nenjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb4f08e25c379e09b0a337ff353eaca7eb249b74","amp;dn":"Arpaktika+%28Raptors%29+%282001-2003%29+%28Greek%29+cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb4f08e25c379e09b0a337ff353eaca7eb249b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,79,8,226,92,55,158,9,176,163,55,255,53,62,172,167,235,36,155,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
