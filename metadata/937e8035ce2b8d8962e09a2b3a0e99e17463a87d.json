Junior Wells - Calling All Blues\n\n\nBlues Harp Heroes is an excellent electric blues collection that dives deeply into the vaults of Cobra, Paula, Jewel, and Chief and comes up with 16 tracks from the '50s and '60s, including four unissued performances from Snooky Pryor (&quot;Real Fine Boogie&quot;), Sonny Boy Williamson (&quot;Take Your Hand Out of My Pocket&quot; and &quot;Steady Rollin' Man&quot;), and George &quot;Wild Child&quot; Butler (&quot;Runnin' Drunk&quot;). Even though a track like Junior Wells' &quot;When the Cat's Gone the Mice Play&quot; is an exact retread of his &quot;Messin With the Kid,&quot; it's still unbeatable electric Chicago blues. One minor complaint: while Bill Dahl's liner notes are informative and well written, Fuel 2000 should include recording dates and years when possible on future releases. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:937e8035ce2b8d8962e09a2b3a0e99e17463a87d","amp;dn":"%28Blues+-+VA%29+Blues+Harp+Heroes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"937e8035ce2b8d8962e09a2b3a0e99e17463a87d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,126,128,53,206,43,141,137,98,224,154,43,58,14,153,225,116,99,168,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
