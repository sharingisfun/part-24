In a sense, I feel this is a better solution than wiping out everything in favour of Wildstormy New52, which is not to say there's some good stories happening there.\n\nCredit to Okcomputo - Novus for the initial up of The Kingdom 01 - 02.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc1f29740305a1dcc5858131c8d527f220afbb2","amp;dn":"The+Kingdom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc1f29740305a1dcc5858131c8d527f220afbb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,193,242,151,64,48,90,29,204,88,88,19,28,141,82,127,34,10,251,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
