May you sell your kidney? May gay men pay surrogates to bear them children? May spouses pay each other to watch the kids, do the dishes, or have sex? Should we allow the rich to genetically engineer gifted, beautiful children? Should we allow betting markets on terrorist attacks and natural disasters?\r\n\r\nMost people shudder at the thought. To put some goods and services for sale offends human dignity. If everything is commodified, then nothing is sacred. The market corrodes our character. Or so most people say.\r\n\r\nIn Markets without Limits, Jason Brennan and Peter Jaworski give markets a fair hearing. The market does not introduce wrongness where there was not any previously.

Contrary to the conservative consensus, they claim there are no inherent limits to what can be bought and sold, but only restrictions on how we buy and sell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c454bbefe3f4e4632be7d7a46b1da80d2817f722","amp;dn":"Markets+without+Limits+%282016%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c454bbefe3f4e4632be7d7a46b1da80d2817f722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,84,187,239,227,244,228,99,43,231,215,164,107,29,168,13,40,23,247,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
