They released two 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ inches and two full length records on Charged records. They were very young when they started the band, and achieved huge popularity all around the country, at such a young age. Chaotic Alliance were known for their politically, and socially charged lyrics, being one of the few street punk bands that actually stood behind their anarchist and substance-free views. They did two full U.S. tours, and many other smaller east with the coast tours.\n\nThis is their first ep please enjoy seed and if you like this artist even if they've broken up support their music by BUYING it. They are now a reformed &quot;cheese&quot; band under the name &quot;Masakari&quot; check them out on Facebook if you'd like.
