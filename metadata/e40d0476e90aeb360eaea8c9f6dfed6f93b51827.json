Contributors include Paul Gambaccini, Don Black, George Martin, \nJohn Barry and Monro's family.\n\n\nMatt Monro (1 December 1930 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7 February 1985) was an English singer who\nbecame one of the most popular entertainers on the international music scene\nduring the 1960s. Throughout his 30-year career, he filled cabarets, nightclubs,\nmusic halls, and stadiums in Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong\nto Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas. He sold more than 100\nmillion records during his lifetime.\n\nHe was born Terence Edward Parsons in Shoreditch, London and attended\nDuncombe School in Islington. Affectionately nicknamed &quot;the singing bus\ndriver&quot; (because one of his many occupations prior to achieving fame was\ndriving the Number 27 bus from Highgate to Teddington) he got his first break\nin 1956 when he became a featured vocalist with the BBC Show Band. An\nimportant influence on his early career was the pianist Winifred Atwell, who\nbecame his mentor, provided him with his stage name, and helped him sign\nwith Decca Records.\n\nIn 1957 Monro released Blue and Sentimental, a collection of standards.\nDespite the album's critical acclaim, Monro languished among the young male\nsingers trying to break through at the end of the 1950s, many of them emulating\nFrankie Vaughan by recording cover versions of American hits. (Monro even\nrecorded a version of Vaughan's &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; during this period.) A short\nrecording contract with Fontana Records followed.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, Monro's mid-decade fame had evaporated, and he\nreturned to relative obscurity. He and his wife Mickie lived from her wages as a\nsong plugger and his royalties from a TV advertising jingle for Camay soap. In\n1959 he recorded a country pastiche song, &quot;Bound for Texas&quot;, for The Chaplin\nRevue, a feature-length compilation of Charlie Chaplin shorts. It would be the\nfirst of many Monro soundtrack themes.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/13197252566704252815.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/13197252566704252815.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nCodec ID                         : mp42\nFile size                        : 597 MiB\nDuration                         : 58mn 53s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1418 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b1f9d8d6d9f1fd829f81&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 3 frames\nBit rate                         : 1254 Kbps\nWidth                            : 708 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                  : Variable\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.123\nWriting library                  : x264 core 79\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 218 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nLanguage                         : English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/85070314906818629418.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/85070314906818629418.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e40d0476e90aeb360eaea8c9f6dfed6f93b51827","amp;dn":"Legends+-+Matt+Monro+-+The+Man+With+The+Golden+Voice+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e40d0476e90aeb360eaea8c9f6dfed6f93b51827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,13,4,118,233,10,235,54,14,174,168,201,246,223,237,111,147,181,24,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
