These types of characters are a lot of fun to build, but they do present their own set of challenges. \n\nIn this training, we'll talk about creating work that matches our reference images. We'll use a variety of polygon methods as well as some spline techniques to build up our alien officer from the ground up. In addition, we'll talk a little about the unique way that geometry can be built in CINEMA 4D, using generators and hierarchy. \n\nWe'll finish by adding some simple materials and in the end you'll have the knowledge you need to begin creating your own character designs.\n\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n1.Introduction and project overview\n\n2.Setting up reference images\n\n3.Blocking in the body shape\n\n4.Prepping arm and leg connections\n\n5.Blocking in the arm shape\n\n6.Building the hand\n\n7.Finishing the hand\n\n8.Blocking in the leg\n\n9.Adding the boot\n\n10.Blocking in the head shape\n\n11.Creating the head topology\n\n12.Building the inner mouth\n\n13.Detailing the mouth\n\n14.Modeling the eyes\n\n15.Detailing the eye sockets\n\n16.Finishing the head\n\n17.Detailing the shirt\n\n18.Detailing the pants\n\n19.Building the belt buckle\n\n20.Modeling the insignia\n\n21.Starting the epaulet\n\n22.Finishing the epaulet\n\n23.Adding head bumps\n\n24.Adding materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5045da3b939598ddf1b7c5dde8769bb22447c1c0","amp;dn":"%5BDigital+Tutors%5D+Creating+Cartoon+Characters+in+CINEMA+4D+Video+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5045da3b939598ddf1b7c5dde8769bb22447c1c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,69,218,59,147,149,152,221,241,183,197,221,232,118,155,178,36,71,193,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
