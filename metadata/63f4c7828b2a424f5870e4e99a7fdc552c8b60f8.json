Released in late 1985, it hit the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in March of 1986, where it was #1 for two weeks. It also hit the top spot on Billboard's Album Rock Tracks chart, where it stayed at #1 for one week, and was also their only #1 single on this chart. In the UK the song peaked at #11 in April 1986.\n\nKÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½rie, elÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ison, which means &quot;Lord, have mercy&quot; in Greek is a part many liturgical rites in Eastern and Western Christianity. KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½rie, elÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ison; ChristÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, elÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ison; KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½rie, elÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ison is a prayer that asks &quot;Lord, have mercy; Christ, have mercy; Lord, have mercy&quot;.\n\nThe words to &quot;Kyrie&quot; were written by lyricist John Lang who co-wrote the songs on all of Mr. Mister's albums. The music was composed by Richard Page and Steve George while on tour with Adam Ant, and according to Page it is essentially a prayer.\n\n    &quot;KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½rie, elÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ison, down the road that I must travel\n    KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½rie, elÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ison, through the darkness of the night&quot;\n\nThe video for this song was directed by Nick Morris, and features the band in performance mixed with footage taken at the tail end of their Fall 1985 tour with Tina Turner.\n\nThere is an myth that singer Richard Page wrote this song while lying in a hospital bed following an unprovoked attack. John Lang has stated that he was the one who was attacked, three years before &quot;Kyrie&quot; was written, and that the incident has nothing to do with the song.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f4c7828b2a424f5870e4e99a7fdc552c8b60f8","amp;dn":"Mr.+Mister+-+Kyrie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f4c7828b2a424f5870e4e99a7fdc552c8b60f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,244,199,130,139,42,66,79,88,112,228,233,154,127,220,85,44,139,96,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
