Their major hits were \\&quot;See You In September\\&quot; (1966), which was originally recorded by the Tempos in 1962, a cover version of the George Gershwin/Ira Gershwin song, \\&quot;I Got Rhythm\\&quot; (1967) updated for the nascent pop/rock era and \\&quot;Hare Krishna\\&quot; a cover version of a song from the musical Hair (1969). The group\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;I Got Rhythm\\&quot; was on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles charts for 14 weeks in 1966, and peaked at number 3.[1]\nThe original group, created in 1965, all hailed from Paterson, New Jersey and consisted of Bob Miranda, David Libert, Tom Giuliano and Ralph DiVito. In 1968, DiVito was replaced by Bernie LaPorta. The band continued in this present configuration, performing mostly at colleges and universities until 1970, when Libert left the band to pursue other endeavors within the music industry. Libert went on to manage various bands, including George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, Living Colour, Brian Auger, Vanilla Fudge, The Runaways (Cherie Currie, Joan Jett, Lita Ford), Mother\\&amp;#039;s Finest and Evelyn \\&quot;Champagne\\&quot; King.\nThe band still exists today and continues to perform with lead singer Miranda, the only remaining original member still in the group\n\n1.
