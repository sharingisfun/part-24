Using this tool, you can make informed decisions about the trust level inside your computer and the safety of your files.\n\nClose\nBlock hackers and stop identity thieves\n\nMore than just Antivirus, AVG Internet Security protects you when shopping and banking, keeping your identity safe. The AVG Firewall prevents inbound and outbound attacks, while Identity Protection secures personal content you enter online.\n\nAVG Enhanced Firewall\n    The AVG Enhanced Firewall protects you from malicious attacks by examining communications on each network port. When the Firewall recognizes an intrusion attempt it will immediately block it and keep your private information safe from inbound attacks, as well as outbound attacks where malicious software takes control of your computer and attempts to cause damage to other people.\n\n    The AVG Enhanced Firewall also includes smart intrusion detection capabilities to keep your home wired or wireless networks secure.\nAVG Identity ProtectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢\n    AVG Identity ProtectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ goes way beyond the typical identity theft protection software. Not only will we keep you safe from online threats - weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re also able to see when anything potentially bad might be happening on your PC, and stop it before it can do any damage.\n\nClose\nAward winning Anti-Virus that just works\n\nAntivirus protection that automatically updates to protect you from continually evolving threats. As hackers develop new techniques, AVGÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s research labs are constantly processing web data to provide new defenses to keep you automatically protected.\n\nAnti-Virus, Anti-Malware, Anti-Spyware\n    Our Anti-Virus technology protects you from falling victim to (or unwittingly spreading) a virus, worm, or Trojan horse. The first layer of protection is traditional anti-virus, which keeps known threats out of your system by matching them to a database.\n\n    AVG Anti-Spyware protects you from Spyware and Adware that can keep track of your personal information.\n\n    AVG Resident Shield provides an additional layer of protection by examining files for threats as they are being copied opened or saved and prevents you opening infected files.\nAVG Protective Cloud Technology\n    Emerging threats are identified ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin the cloudÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and prevented from infecting your computer via AVGÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s automatic updates to your anti-virus software.\nAVG Community Protection Network\n    Information about the latest threats is collected from customers who choose to participate, enabling us to constantly identify new threats, supporting everyone in the AVG community and helping us to provide superior anti-virus protection.\n\nClose\nGaming and surfing without interruptions\n\nGet on with your surfing and gaming without interference. Scans operate when you are away from your PC, and it also knows when you are gaming and ensures that the security operates in the background only, leaving you free to play.\n\nAVG Smart Scanning\n    Our intelligent and lightweight smart scanning technology operates in high-priority mode while youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re away from your PC and drops into low-priority mode when you move your mouse or strike a key. AVG Smart Scanning ignores files it has scanned in the past and already knows are safe, enabling vast improvements in scan times.\nGame Mode\n    AVGÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Game Mode provides non-stop protection during non-stop action in multi-player games like Call of Duty without annoying lags and freezes caused by scheduled updates and scans.

It checks files against both AVGÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Scanning Engine and our own LinkScanner technology. Instant Messaging Protection also makes sure you are safe when exchanging files using ICQ, MSN and Yahoo! instant messenger.\nAVG Email Scanner\n    AVG E-mail Scanner checks attachments and links sent in emails for threats so that they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t arrive in your inbox and cause damage. AVG E-mail scanner works as a plug-in for email applications ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including Microsoft Outlook 2010 - or as a personal e-mail scanner on accounts that use POP3 and SMTP.\n\nClose\nSurf and search the web safely\n\nYou want to search and surf, but you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ever want to go to any infected websites. AVG helps you out by clearly alerting you to threats and keeping you clear of them.\n\nLinkScannerÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Search-Shield\n    AVG LinkScannerÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® shows safety ratings in your search engine results, allowing you to assess the safety of a site before you go there. Search-Shield works with Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other popular search providers, by placing a safety rating next to each link, letting you know which sites can be trusted and which are to be avoided. Sites are rated in four categories, each of which is colour-coded for easy recognition.\nLinkScannerÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Surf-Shield\n    AVG Surf-Shield actively checks web pages in real-time at the only time it matters - before you land on that page. If it detects something suspicious, it prevents you from visiting the site. Surf-Shield protects you both when you click a link to a web page and every time you enter a web address directly into your browser. In AVG 2011 we have improved LinkScanner further to give our best detection rates ever.\n\nClose\nShare your life on Facebook, not viruses\n\nWith AVG protecting your system, you can chat and message your friends on Facebook and other social networks in the knowledge that each web page and link is checked for safety. You wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t pick up a malicious link from your friends - and you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t send one either!\n\nAVG Social Networking Protection\n    AVG Social Networking Protection is powerful in AVG 2012 and is unique to AVG.

Regardless of being an installation query, a product configuration or an AVG technical related question we are here to take the stress out of your life and make sure you are fully protected.\nAVG Advisor\n    AVG Advisor is a new proactive service that constantly monitors the computer and advises the user with solutions on various computer problems they may have. We know that many of our customers have browsers and other applications open for many hours without knowing these applications are constantly consuming the available memory of their PC. Over time, the available memory becomes low and causes the computer to slow down. AVG Advisor will help with such problems by advising you of the potential issue and helping you to rectify it.\n\n\nSerials &amp; Info in info + keys.txt\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7610f0d096644db6d90bfd3c6cbce44a96a9a69c","amp;dn":"Avg+Internet+Security+2012+%5B32+%26amp%3B+64+bit+with+keys+till+2018%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7610f0d096644db6d90bfd3c6cbce44a96a9a69c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,16,240,208,150,100,77,182,217,11,253,60,108,188,228,74,150,169,166,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
