and the answer is that after for example 5 aplications that are open on the machine is needed to have them ready to go about for example 3 giga with them open , with the rollback portability because they\nare usual in compressed state they have not 3 giga but 1 .5 gb (half-size) for example and they still ready to go the only difference are a few seconds that are necessary to open the rollback portable to run and only them he is spending the real space size on the machine and get abck to compressed state at the end , so if we have the aplications in rollback portability the maximum hard drive space spended with for example 1 of them running is 2 giga for example otherwise if they are always open they spended always 3 giga , so for few seconds wait in a few aplications we saved 1 giga without any inconvenience and then we can have even more aplications for not too much size because we saved space for them ... ok i think all of you already figured out how this works and why and i hope this aplications style makes sense to any of you too as make sense to me ... have fun and read the rest of the notes ...\n\n-2-\nIMPORTANT : the rollback portable can run anywhere you want that have enough space for the current running aplication , for example for this photoshop aplication if you have 500 mb space on the place you are running the aplication it will be ok , no problem and this can be of course usb , external hard drives or the main computer hard drive but there is a curiosity that can be important , the rollback effect happens in a virtual environment that needs tranquility as possible to run , so the best place to the effect be more effective and fast is inside an empty folder (you can run the aplication on this folder besides this small txt) but the point of this curiosity is that real open environments can cause delays or inconveniences with other aplications running at the same time like the desktop or the primary external hard drive or the main usb besides that probably will run but taking more time , so this type of aplication will run better and faster in empty folders that are created specially for the use of the rollback portable that we want to use , so the user can have this folder anywhere he wants but the aplication is inside an empty folder that was selected to run the rollback aplication like an installation program that needs to be keeped inside a folder until the uninstalling time and thatÃ‚Â´s it i think this note now makes sense to anyone of you ...\n\n-3-\nThis aplication have a built-in 21 languages selector maded for myself because unfornatly the intial portable that i used to make this rollback work was tricky and bugged on the languages selection from the user , that means that inside the program besides the user selected a new language the program stayed with the lÃƒÂ§anguage what already have not changing a thing and then an ini file that was recommened to change the language in there wasnÃ‚Â´t working too because the most important file to accept a new language was always the same no matter what language was choosed on the ini and after checked thsis details on the apliaction languages i decided to made a language selector myself that will run evry single time that the aplication runs and the user just select from a 21 languages menu the wanted language for the aplication and then donÃ‚Â´t need to do more anything besides a register administrator prompt that is needed to use freely the aplication to have the aplication running fine with the selected language , if you want to change the language just close the current running of aplication then loose 10 seconds or something and select a new language from the languages selector and enjoy the new language and this can be maded how many times the user wants ... so under the circunstances certainly much more acceptable conditions to change the language that i get with the initial portable i used to work , so i wish to all of yopu happy aplication in your prefered language quickly without any problem at anytime ... see you around ...\n\n\n\n\n* ADOBE PHOTOSHOP CS6 ROLLBACK PORTABLE * 32PLAY * 2015 *\n\n\n\n\nHave fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:481356981c115d5c953a7f11162e3d2cb0732e5e","amp;dn":"AdobePhotoshopCS6RollBackPortable+-+32play","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"481356981c115d5c953a7f11162e3d2cb0732e5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,19,86,152,28,17,93,92,149,58,127,17,22,46,61,44,176,115,46,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
