Hall), a charismatic blood spatter analyst who works in the forensics at the Miami Metro Police Department. On the outside, Dexter seems like the perfect guy -- he has a sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), that adores him and a steady girlfriend, Rita (Julie Benz), with two kids that look up to him.

Basing his life on the teachings of his foster father, Dexter only kills people who truly deserve it: he ensures that those who got away with horrible crimes will never kill again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8fb6044313e3628abfed29b531ff7212a4a48e2","amp;dn":"Dexter.S08E11.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8fb6044313e3628abfed29b531ff7212a4a48e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,251,96,68,49,62,54,40,171,254,210,155,83,31,247,33,42,74,72,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
