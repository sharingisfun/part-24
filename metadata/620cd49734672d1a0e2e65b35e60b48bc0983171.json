The Emperor's sculptor, Chaudet, made the original model, and from this were cast bronze copies in the workshop of Thomire, which would be proudly borne into battle by many a French regiment. This fascinating work by Terence Wise explores in depth the flags, colours and guidons of the Napoleonic Wars (1799-1815), concentrating on France and her allies, and covering every faction from Baden to WÃƒÂ¼rzburg. This book is a must for anyone interested in this fascinating topic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:620cd49734672d1a0e2e65b35e60b48bc0983171","amp;dn":"Flags+of+the+Napoleonic+Wars+%281%29+%3A+France+and+Her+Allies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"620cd49734672d1a0e2e65b35e60b48bc0983171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,12,212,151,52,103,45,26,14,46,101,179,94,96,180,139,192,152,49,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
