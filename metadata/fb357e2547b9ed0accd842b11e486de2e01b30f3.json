More importantly, the record crackles with the raw, spontaneous energy of a live show, something often absent from many modern blues albums.\n\n\nGear Magazine\nThe album roars into life with a raucous onslaught of soupy, swampy, scruff-of-the-neck revved up Hendrix-y electric guitar, as the appropriately-titled \\&quot;Meltdown At The Hoo\\&quot; hits top gear and hammers away at your senses! The whole album of killer tunes represents a definite melding of traditional blues-meets-the-21st century.\n\n\nSteve Bailey, Guitar &amp; Bass Magazine\nEquipped with just guitar, vocals and drums, this duo march into battle taking on every blues-rock trick in the book, successfully blasting them to a new level. The duo format leaves plenty of room for Gwyn\\'s muscular licks that induce the \\'wow\\' factor time and time again. No-nonsense, brutal and invigorating.\n\n\nBlues Matters\nUnlike many of his contemporaries Ashton does not resort to clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, pomp and bluster, but lays down terrific riffs and inserts just enough light and shade to make him a leader in this genre...this is top drawer stuff.\n\n\nBillboard.Com\nSouth Australia\\'s greatest contribution to blues-rock.\n\n\nCD Description\nMulti award winning guitarist Gwyn Ashton hails from Adelaide and has been described as Australia\\'s own Stevie Ray Vaughan. Over the years he has built a solid reputation as a virtuoso guitarist and performer touring and sharing the stage the world over with the likes of Rory Gallagher Buddy Guy, Johnny Winter &amp; Black Sabbath. Gwyn\\'s latest project is an alternative guitar and drums blues and roots/rock power duo with drummer Kev Hickman making creative use of fuzzed out bottleneck slide, octave, dividers, delays and loops!
