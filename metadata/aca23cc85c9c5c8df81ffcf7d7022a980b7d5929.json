Comming out of Dusseldorf, the \nband originally formed in 1982, comprised of 6 members: Trini Trimpop (Drums), \nAndi (bass), Kuddel (guitar), Breiti (guitar), Walter (guitar), and Campino \n(Vocals). They had all been in bands before, and they had studied such rock \nclassics as Gary Glitter, Slade, Chelsea, and Motorhead, as well as making some \ntrips to London. They&amp;#039;re first single was &quot;Wir Sind Bereit&quot; (&quot;We&amp;#039;re ready&quot;) and \n&quot;Reisefeber&quot; (Travel Bug), recorded in one afternoon at &quot;Rudas Studio&quot; in \nDusseldorf. After its release they made their first tour, planning to play small \nclubs for a low cover charge-- this amounted to all sorts of choas and wild \nparties as the band traveled around the country meeting people, and as they \nwrestled with not having a place to sleep, not always being paid, etc. The press \ncalled them &quot;The successful surviors, more or less of the first German punk \nmovement&quot;. \n\nSounds like they had a good time. \n\nDescription taken from: http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1071693","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aca23cc85c9c5c8df81ffcf7d7022a980b7d5929","amp;dn":"Die+Toten+Hosen+%5B1999%5D+Crash+Landing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aca23cc85c9c5c8df81ffcf7d7022a980b7d5929","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,162,60,200,92,156,92,141,248,31,252,247,215,2,42,152,11,125,89,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
