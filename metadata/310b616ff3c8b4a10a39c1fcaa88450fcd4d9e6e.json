LanggÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd plays acoustic guitar, piano, zither and harmonium; she also arranged the strings that intermittently accompany her. Across the eight tracks, she is joined by 10 other musicians, bur never en masse; her voice remains central throughout, with sparse instrumentation employed to subtly frame it and add coloration. \n\n\nLanggÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd is the latest in an ongoing procession of distinctive Norwegian vocalists, following Susanna Karolina WallumrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸d (and the Magical Orchestra), Mariam Walletin (of Wildbirds and Peacedrums) and Jenny Hval. LanggÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s light, ethereal voice clearly has Nordic roots, but it has little else in common with any in that list, and owes no obvious debt to any singer. \n\n\nThe music is predominantly acoustic. If itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rooted in folk music, those roots are not evident. The diffuse, hummable melodies of LanggÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs are psychedelic if anything. Afterward, they do not lodge in the memory, and the listener is left with impressions of the overall sound and mood of the music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ fitting, as those are the greatest strengths of The Sea. \n\n\nHarmony instruments ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including accordion, Hammond organ, vibraphone and zither ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ predominate, and Thora Dolven frequently harmonizes with LanggÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd on backing vocals. The only instruments that do occasionally emerge from the ensemble are Lise SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸rensenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lilting violin and viola. Otherwise, the voice is in the spotlight. \n\n\nLanggÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics are as diffuse as the music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ no bad thing. Most have no narrative, and often the vocals convey moods and emotions more than literal meaning. Many lyrics seem chosen for their sound, with the exceptions being ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlack DogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSister.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ While titles such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeath Will Come,&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe First to DieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Darkest HourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ hint at common themes, these are never fully articulated or developed. Consequently, it is difficult to hear The Sea as the start of a trilogy -- there is no obvious coherent theme running through that could be developed on two further albums. Nonetheless, it is stylistically coherent and hangs together well. If PhaedraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s next two albums continue in a similar manner to this hauntingly beautiful debut, they will be worth the effort.\n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:310b616ff3c8b4a10a39c1fcaa88450fcd4d9e6e","amp;dn":"Phaedra...The+Sea%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"310b616ff3c8b4a10a39c1fcaa88450fcd4d9e6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,11,97,111,243,200,180,161,10,57,193,252,170,136,69,15,205,77,158,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
