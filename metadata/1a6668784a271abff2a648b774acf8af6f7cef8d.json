(Springer, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book covers fundamentals of organometal perovskite materials and their photovoltaics, including materials preparation and device fabrications. Special emphasis is given to halide perovskites. The opto-electronic properties of perovskite materials and recent progress in perovskite solar cells are described. In addition, comments on the issues to current and future challenges are mentioned","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a6668784a271abff2a648b774acf8af6f7cef8d","amp;dn":"Organic-Inorganic+Halide+Perovskite+Photovoltaics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a6668784a271abff2a648b774acf8af6f7cef8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,102,104,120,74,39,26,191,242,166,72,183,116,172,248,175,111,124,239,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
