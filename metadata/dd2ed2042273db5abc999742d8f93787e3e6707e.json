Despite emerging in the toughest year for the music\n\n industry, these labels survived and were eventually flourishing in 2013, ten years later \n\nThis documentary tells the story of this explosive decade. \n\nA decade which saw the art of DJing and performance be transformed by new technology; the musical landscape change,\n\ndiverge and constantly evolve; the genre being embraced and adopted by the USA through EDM, \n\nand finally react against this by going back to its roots.\n\nSome of the biggest acts in dance music give their frank and honest opinions. Toolroom TV gets the unique,\n\nbehind the scenes access to the likes of Steve Angello (Swedish House Mafia), Hardwell,\n\nSub Focus and Loco Dice at their most candid.\n\n\n10 Years Of Dance Music: The Playlist\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1.
