But what is awareness and what constitutes a level of awareness? \nAnd, if we knew a level of awareness when we saw one, how would the movement \nfrom one level to another be accomplished? It is these and other thorny questions \nthat The Alchemy of Awareness attempts to address.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76488433fd6c04273ad862a602f7be24fb5c85d3","amp;dn":"The+Alchemy+of+Awareness%5B2009%5D-LW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76488433fd6c04273ad862a602f7be24fb5c85d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,72,132,51,253,108,4,39,58,216,98,166,2,247,190,36,251,92,133,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
