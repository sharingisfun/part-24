I failed dismally. Dimento is treated horribly by the other characters and I must shoulder the blame for his misfortunes.&quot; - Jan Strnad","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e08f197a6a11e9471fc81aa513da20d1c17a4951","amp;dn":"Richard+Corben+-+Mutant+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e08f197a6a11e9471fc81aa513da20d1c17a4951","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,143,25,122,106,17,233,71,31,200,26,165,19,218,32,209,193,122,73,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
