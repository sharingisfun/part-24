Artist Scott Lee has an appealing anime big-eye style and creates commendably grimy and realistic locations. He also knows which parts of girls he likes, and manages to emphasize them throughout. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hope he sees some real ones some day. Fabian Nicieza writes up a storm. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wit, imagination, and some very funny dialogue, especially from an erudite enforcer who quotes from Bertrand Russell, and a gangster who takes Huggy Bear as his inspiration. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect much beyond girls and guns and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be pleasantly surprised, but come expecting anything more and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be disappointed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4828e04f9fc4e82a0d74a9fe9dce9c1b0e97c3e","amp;dn":"22+Brides+%231-4+%281996%29+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4828e04f9fc4e82a0d74a9fe9dce9c1b0e97c3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,130,142,4,249,252,78,130,160,215,74,159,233,220,233,193,176,233,124,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
