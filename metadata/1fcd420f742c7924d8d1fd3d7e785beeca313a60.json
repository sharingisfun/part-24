I changed the      hotkeys for those using 0 to 9 keys.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fcd420f742c7924d8d1fd3d7e785beeca313a60","amp;dn":"Dungeon+Siege+2+-+Broken+Sword+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fcd420f742c7924d8d1fd3d7e785beeca313a60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,205,66,15,116,44,121,36,216,209,253,61,126,120,91,238,202,49,58,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
