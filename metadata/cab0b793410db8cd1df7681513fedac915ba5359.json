A. Thrower &amp; Friends - Papa Never Let Me Sing The Blues [1972]\n\n2010 - Riverman Music / BTR0040 / Korean Exlcusive CD Release Housed in Mini LP Sleeve / CD\n\nDeacon Productions released 100 copies of Papa in 1971/1972. Both John Drendall (vocals/guitar) and B.A. Thrower (bass guitar/electric guitar/organ) lived on the campus of Michigan University in Lansing.\n\nThe two eventually moved into a suburban house with a spacious garage. This garage was turned into a studio where the group practiced hours on end. Eventually Drendall and Thrower found a studio in Kalamazoo that would record their experiments. Friends Tommy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stiff Finger EddieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Caruso (slide guitar), Mike Ã¢â‚¬Å“ElmoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Skory (keyboards), Vern Ã¢â‚¬Å“The BopperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Albaugh (flute), Nelson Wood (harp), Jimmie Spillane (backgrounds), and Ross Maxwell (bells and anything else) add many valuable contributions to the album. The music is very fine Americana, a true undiscovered gem that needs to be heard by more music fans.\n\nThe performances on Papa sparkle with a true level of professionalism. Drendall, Thrower and their Ã¢â‚¬Å“FriendsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are all excellent musicians, the songwriting is stellar, and the production sounds top notch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on par with a major label rock group.\n\nThose of you who enjoyed Euphoria (the Texas country-rock group), Crazy Horse, and Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere era Neil Young will fall for this record in a big way. One of the songs on Papa, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Old Man Gibbs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds like an early Neil Young number in that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great rootsy rocker with stoned electric guitar work and burnt out lyrics.\n\nThe album opener, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cold Nite in August,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ stands out as the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most blues oriented cut, 6+ minutes of laid back country-blues thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s well worth hearing. Other highlights are the title track and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get Too Heavy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both acoustic gems that feature solid guitar picking and in the case of the latter, good, close harmonies.\n\nEven the psychedelic numbers, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black River LadyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I FeelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are fabulous mood music that conjures up a spacey atmosphere more in line with the late 60s. My favorite tracks are the nifty country-rocker Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bye Bye Mr. Jones,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with its amusing group dialogue and the great Ã¢â‚¬Å“Throw Off Your Troubled Past.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This last number features frantic guitar work (the guitarist really shreds up the fretboard on this one) and busy percussion; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really a treat to hear these last two numbers.\n\nThe album as a whole is uniformly strong and a must hear; not a bad cut on this LP.\nSo once again, Papa is a very accomplished work that should have been reissued years ago. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been plenty of great reissues in 2009 but Papa is one of the best IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard so far. (http://therisingstorm.net/)\n\n++TRACK LIST++\n\n1. Cold Nite In August\n2.
