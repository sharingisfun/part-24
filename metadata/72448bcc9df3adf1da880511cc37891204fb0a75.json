Offbeat film narrated by Rob Brydon, which takes us to the Wild West where prairie dogs live in huge colonies known as 'towns'. Like meerkats, they are comical to watch, but there is a whole lot more to prairie dogs than just being cute - they can talk. For 30 years Professor Con Slobodchikoff has been recording their calls in response to predators and he believes he has discovered a language second only to humans in its complexity. It's a bold claim but is he right?\n\nTechnical Specs for Hi-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nRun-Time: 58mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.79GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\n\nforums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72448bcc9df3adf1da880511cc37891204fb0a75","amp;dn":"BBC+Natural+World+2010+Prairie+Dogs+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVgroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72448bcc9df3adf1da880511cc37891204fb0a75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,68,139,204,157,243,173,241,218,136,5,17,204,55,137,18,4,251,10,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
