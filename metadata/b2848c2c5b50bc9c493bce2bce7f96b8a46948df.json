Namco is celebrating 50 years of bringing you the greatest games on the planet by releasing the biggest and best compilation of time-honored, all-star arcade classics for the PC. Namco Museum 50th Anniversary features 16 of the most treasured Namco original games in arcade history wrapped up in a retro-cool menu interface that allows you to explore a virtual arcade and dominate your favorite games. Because this museum was developed by Digital Eclipse rather than Mass Media, it features &quot;true&quot; arcade game emulation (the games are emulated using the original game ROMs). Relive your arcade years and rock out to a cool 80's soundtrack that takes you back to glory days of arcade gaming and this time...leave your quarters at home.\n\n\nGame List:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Pac-Man (1980)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Pac-Mania (1987)*\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ms. Pac-Man (1981)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Galaga (1981)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Galaga '88 (1987)*\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Galaxian (1979)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bosconian (1981)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dig Dug (1982)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dragon Spirit (1987)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mappy (1983)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Pole Position (1982)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Pole Position II (1983)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Rally X (1980)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Rolling Thunder (1986)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sky Kid (1985)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Xevious (1982)\n\n* Pac-Mania and Galaga '88 are locked initially and require 15000 points in Pac-Man, 20000 in Ms Pac-Man and 40000 in Galaga to unlock\n\n\nExtra's: \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ You can launch each game individually by running the batch files in the Games \n  Directory\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The batch files launch the games without the &quot;Press 1 - ONE PLAYER START / \n  Press 2 - TWO PLAYER START&quot; info screens so you can see the rolling demo's \n  without interference :) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ If you want to load a game in Windowed Mode, edit the batch file and add -window \n  to the commandline\n\n  Example: N50.dat -window -game Galaga88\n\n\nCredits: Starforce protection removed by RELOADED\n\n\nInstall: Extract &amp; Play (run NM50A.exe)\n\n\nCheers,\n\nADHDerby\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2848c2c5b50bc9c493bce2bce7f96b8a46948df","amp;dn":"Namco+Museum+50th+Anniversary+%5BPortable%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2848c2c5b50bc9c493bce2bce7f96b8a46948df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,132,140,44,91,80,188,156,73,59,206,43,206,127,150,184,164,105,72,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
