The quintet performs four of the trumpeter's originals (including &quot;Lament for Booker&quot; and the title cut) plus an advanced version of the standard &quot;You're My Everything.&quot; John Coltrane's modal music was starting to influence Hubbard's conception and his own playing was pushing the modern mainstream ahead without really entering the avant-garde. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. You're My Everything\n02. Prophet Jennings\n03. Hub-Tones\n04. Lament For Booker\n05. For Spee's Sake\n06. You're My Everything (Alternate Take)\n07.
