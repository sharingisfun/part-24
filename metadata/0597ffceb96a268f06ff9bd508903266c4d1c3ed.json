During hip hop's &quot;golden age,&quot; they were almost-universally regarded as the premier MC/DJ combo in rap. The two had a potent chemistry and each represented the height of innovation in their respective roles: Rakim was the master lyricist, an innovative talent who pushed the art of hip hop lyricism to new creative heights with his use of internal rhyme, sophisticated metaphors, and with a methodical-yet-effortless delivery; Eric B. built on the hard-hitting beats of Run-D.M.C. by adding James Brown samples and his extensive scratching skills, setting the stage for hip hop's late-80s/early-90s infatuation with samples from the Godfather of Soul.[1] Though they never had much success on the charts, Eric B. &amp; Rakim are commonly considered one of the greatest hip hop acts of all time, and Rakim, because of his innovation, influence, historical importance and tremendous skill is often considered by many fans and critics to be the greatest MC of all time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaid in Full ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Remixes \n\n\nPaid in Full is the debut studio album of hip hop duo Eric B. &amp; Rakim, released on July 7, 1987 through the Island subsidiary label 4th &amp; B'way Records. After Rakim responded to Eric B.'s search for a rapper to complement his disc jockey work in 1985, the duo recorded the album at hip hop producer Marley Marl's home studio and Power Play Studios in New York City. The album peaked at number fifty-eight on the Billboard 200 and produced five singles; &quot;Eric B. Is President&quot;, &quot;I Ain't No Joke&quot;, &quot;I Know You Got Soul&quot;, &quot;Move the Crowd&quot;, and &quot;Paid in Full&quot;.\n\nPaid in Full is credited as a benchmark album of golden age hip hop. Rakim's rapping, which pioneered the use of internal rhymes in hip hop, set a higher standard of lyricism in the genre and served as a template for future rappers. The album's heavy sampling by Eric B. became influential in hip hop production. The record has sold over a million copies and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it platinum in 1995. In 2003, the album was ranked number 227 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\nPaid in Full (Seven Minutes of Madness ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Cold Cut remix)\nI Know You Got Soul (The Richie Rich MegaMix)\nMove the Crowd (The Wild Bunch Remix)\nPaid in Full (Derek BÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Urban Respray)\nAs the Rhyme Goes On (Pumpin the Turbo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Chad Jay in Effect)\nMove the Crowd (Beatmix by the Democratic 3 Feat.
