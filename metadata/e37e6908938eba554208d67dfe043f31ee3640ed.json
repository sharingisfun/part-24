Having spent the winter of '76 honing their skills and setlist, they soon scored their first record contract and their debut album, The Cars, was released in 1977. Helped by singles including &quot;My Best Friend's Girl&quot;, the album went platinum by the end of the year. They followed this with a Top 5 success, Candy-O, in 1979.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e37e6908938eba554208d67dfe043f31ee3640ed","amp;dn":"The+Cars+-+Candy-O+%5BHDCD%5D+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e37e6908938eba554208d67dfe043f31ee3640ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,126,105,8,147,142,186,85,66,8,214,125,254,4,63,49,238,54,64,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
