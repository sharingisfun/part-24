John Lanzrath - The Joy of Stewardship: Time, Treasure, and Talents [audio presentation]\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be a faithful steward? How is stewardship intimately linked with the Eucharist as a response of our faith in God for His many blessings? Fr. John Lanzrath shows us how to develop an attitude of gratitude to grow in grace, incorporate a spirituality of stewardship in every aspect of daily life, and overcome the selfishness that keeps us from recognizing God's gifts.\r\n \nhttps://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/the-joy-of-stewardship\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please seed and support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.
