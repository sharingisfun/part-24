Dani inherits a castle in Ireland from a long lost aunt but gets more than she bargained for when she arrives. Is the Castle really hers or will she have to untangle the branches of her family tree? An unknown cousin in the shape of accident-prone Jimmy has claimed the castle as his own as well. At least Dani has new friends in the shape of local girl horse-loving Kaitlin and her brother, wannabe-magician Leo. Not to mention a new admirer who materialises when she meets some other very distant and very ghostly family members who have lived in the castle for 250 years!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:787eabc60d94a26d346541c5a41df92ed8aa3079","amp;dn":"DANI%26rsquo%3BS+CASTLE+S01E01+-+The+Castle+HDTV.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"787eabc60d94a26d346541c5a41df92ed8aa3079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,126,171,198,13,148,162,109,52,101,65,197,164,29,249,46,216,170,48,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
