You'll face dozens of dangerous enemies while you find new and powerful spells, and learn helpful perks in your quest to overcome this deadly test.\n\nUpdate 15 changelog:\n- New Level 1 Boss: King Blob (name's not necessarily final). It'll probably need a bit more balancing, it's probably easier than the other L1 bosses right now.\n- Each character has now a slightly different wand (still weaker than most standard weapons).\n- Added sounds to the alternate fires of some weapons.\n- Your current health / mana numbers are shown in the character details screen.\n- Fixed some issues with water reflections that were introduced in the previous update.\n- Added a warning when trying to start a new game, and there's a saved game.\n- Other minor bugfixes.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it!          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/308420/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/308420/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebb61baeceff92fe018c392d28a738d7faf5400e","amp;dn":"Ziggurat+%28Update+15%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebb61baeceff92fe018c392d28a738d7faf5400e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,182,27,174,206,255,146,254,1,140,57,45,40,167,56,215,250,245,64,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
