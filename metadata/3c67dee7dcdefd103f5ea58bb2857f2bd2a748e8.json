Reports about the devastating effects of global warming and climate change are not new but they grow increasingly alarming as time passes. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“City of Layers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tackles current issues that involve climate change, population growth and the human populationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impact on the environment. This is a multi-disciplinary work, crossing the boundaries of architecture, business, science and politics to provide a coherent and holistic view of what is needed to enable and achieve a sustainable future.  \n\nEnabling sustainability in the built environment is a complex topic and to achieve, requires significantly more than a piecemeal approach; it has many different factors that must be appropriately considered and necessitates input from many different disciplines and specialist, all which must be brought together to ensure sustainability is enabled and then later achieved. The Ã¢â‚¬ËœCity of LayersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ book has combined all these factors and requirements into one reference book, which not only details how sustainability could be achieved, but also how certain individual choices and business decisions can be used to influence what eventuates and ensure any possible impacts are reduced.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c67dee7dcdefd103f5ea58bb2857f2bd2a748e8","amp;dn":"Sustainability+%26ndash%3B+City+of+Layers%2C+Enabling+Sustainability+i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c67dee7dcdefd103f5ea58bb2857f2bd2a748e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,103,222,231,220,222,253,16,63,94,165,139,178,133,127,43,210,167,72,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
