Her parents, Jerry and Phyllis, fly to Italy to meet her fiancÃƒÂ© and his parents. Jerry happens to hear GiancarloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (Michelangelo's father) beautiful operatic voice while the latter sings in the shower. As a former admittedly avant-garde and critically reviled opera director, Jerry feels inspired to bring GiancarloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gift to the public. Although Giancarlo protests that he sings for himself and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to go professional, Jerry pushes the issue until Giancarlo agrees to audition in front of a room of opera bigwigs. Outside the safety of his shower, GiancarloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s confidence abandons him. He makes faces and he is humiliated. Michelangelo, who attended the audition too, accuses Jerry of using his father to achieve some level of fame for himself. It occurs to Jerry that Giancarlo, like most people, sings the most confidently when he has some measure of privacy. In GiancarloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s case, he performs best in his shower. Giancarlo, naked but for a towel, premieres at the Teatro dellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Opera di Roma. Jerry has built him a shower onstage, and Giancarlo sings as he washes. The opera attendees love his strange performance, so Jerry and Giancarlo decide to stage Pagliacci, shower and all. Again, GiancarloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rich voice mesmerizes the crowd, and he receives rave reviews though Jerry's direction is once again utterly reviled, a fact he is not aware of since he doesn't understand Italian. Giancarlo decides to retire from opera singing, because he prefers working as a mortician and spending time with his family though he appreciates being given the chance to live his dream of performing Pagliacci.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c23781211062455872eee6a96408cb5b00c55782","amp;dn":"To+Rome+With+Love.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c23781211062455872eee6a96408cb5b00c55782","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,55,129,33,16,98,69,88,114,238,230,169,100,8,203,91,0,197,87,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
