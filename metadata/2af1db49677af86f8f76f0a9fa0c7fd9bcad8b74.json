Other singers were more popular, others were equally skilled, but few other African-American musicians were so influential over the course of popular music. And no other musician, pop or otherwise, put on a more exciting, exhilarating stage show: Brown's performances were marvels of athletic stamina and split-second timing.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Love Don't Love Nobody\n02.I Don't Mind\n03.Come Over Here\n04.And I Do Just What I Want\n05.Just You And Me\n06.So Long\n07.Tell Me What You're Gonna Do\n08.The Bells\n09.Dancin' Little Things\n10.You Don't Have To Go\n11.Lost Someone\n12.I Love You, Yes I Do\n\n\n\n\nDisc 2 (Live)\n\n\n01.Give It Up, Turn It Loose\n02.Too Funky In Here\n03.Gonna Have A Funky Good Time\n04.Try Me\n05.Get On The Good Foot\n06.Get Up Offa That Thing\n07.Georgia On My Mind\n08.Hot Pants\n09.I Got The Feeling\n10.It's A Man's Man's Man's World\n11.Cold Sweat\n12.I Can't Stand It\n13.Papa's Got A Brand New Bag\n14.I Feel Good\n15.Please, Please, Please\n16.Jam\n17.Sex Machine\n\n\n\n\n\nP2P &amp; File Sharing Technology is completely legal.
