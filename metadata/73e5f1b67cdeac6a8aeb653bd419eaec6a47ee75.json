It can leave you with a tenuous feeling and fill you with dread that you might slip and fall. But it can also provide you with moments of real clarity and offer a vantage point some never get to experience. That seems to be where we find Red Moon Road with the release of their full length debut. The real, telling move will be their next one. Will they continue to climb or will they fall?\n\nRed Moon Road is a mostly charming excursion down the rock/folk path. The album offers the listener some great instrumentation, impressive lyrics, and enough variety to keep things interesting. You get the feeling this band is going somewhere, although a definitive flight path has yet to be filed. And while there are some good signs here, I for one feel the band has yet to hit its full stride and may even be playing things a little too safe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73e5f1b67cdeac6a8aeb653bd419eaec6a47ee75","amp;dn":"Red+Moon+Road+-+Red+Moon+Road+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73e5f1b67cdeac6a8aeb653bd419eaec6a47ee75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,229,241,182,124,222,172,106,138,235,101,59,212,25,234,236,106,71,238,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
