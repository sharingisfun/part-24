It is a bridge to the often difficult doctrines of the early church fathers, explaining the spiritual psychology of the fathers that underlies the current renewal of spirituality in the Greek church. This renewal, like this book, is closely linked to the understandings of the modern monks and abbots on Mount Athos. A Different Christianity is useful to the practitioner, as well as to the scholar, providing new insights into the problems of studying and following the spiritual path outside of a monastery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5582137e5a71e1d93e297c23ac274ae3a2883e5","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1995%5D+A+Different+Christianity+Early+Christian+Esotericis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5582137e5a71e1d93e297c23ac274ae3a2883e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,88,33,55,229,167,30,29,147,226,151,194,58,194,116,174,58,40,131,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
