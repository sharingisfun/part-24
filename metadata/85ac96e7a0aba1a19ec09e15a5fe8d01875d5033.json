Who better than bestselling author and Vanity Fair columnist Dominick Dunne to expose the sordid secrets of America's rich and famous? Already an established Hollywood producer in the late 70s, Dunne left the world of Los Angeles to live a simpler kind of life and work on his writing. A personal tragedy soon gave Dunne a clear purpose: to draw attention to those members of high society who believe their wealth and privilege exempt them from legal repercussions. Eager to hold these parties accountable for their mistakes, Dunne has dedicated his time to exploring the seedy underbelly of fame and celebrity ever since.\n\n\nEpisode 2 : Marriage of Inconvenience - Palm Beach Divorce Murder\n\nThe murder of an Atlanta socialite goes unsolved for 13 years until one of the hit men confesses that the woman's husband was responsible. Millionaire James Sullivan is accused of hiring a hit man to murder his wife in 1985, but vanishes after a warrant is issued for his arrest 13 years later.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2250 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 624x472\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.322:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 5\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 42:05.048\nNumber Of Parts: 8\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85ac96e7a0aba1a19ec09e15a5fe8d01875d5033","amp;dn":"CourtTV.Power.Privilege.and.Justice.2of8.Marriage.of.Inconvenien","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85ac96e7a0aba1a19ec09e15a5fe8d01875d5033","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,172,150,231,160,171,161,161,158,192,158,21,165,254,141,1,135,93,80,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
