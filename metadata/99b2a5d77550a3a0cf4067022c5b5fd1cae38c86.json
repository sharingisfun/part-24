Now she sweeps us to a time and place of\nfiery power struggles, where one woman holds the key to a\ncountry's future--and to her own consuming passion.\n\nWhen Fiona Hay offers Angus Gordon her virtue in exchange\nfor a dowry for her sisters, she so intrigues the rogue that\nhe demands a higher payment: She will be his mistress. Thus\nbegins a battle of wills and sensual delights. Destiny soon\ndraws the ardent lovers into the turbulent court of King\nJames. But soon the king's political schemes force Fiona away\nfrom the man she loves . . . and into the arms of a wild and\npassionate Highlander, The MacDonald of Nairn. Will this\ncoldhearted and callous betrayal forever destroy Fiona's\nchance at happiness?\n\n\nBetrayed\nby Bertrice Small\nLanguage: EN\nPages: EPUB 660","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b2a5d77550a3a0cf4067022c5b5fd1cae38c86","amp;dn":"Betrayed++by+Bertrice+Small+EPUB+EN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b2a5d77550a3a0cf4067022c5b5fd1cae38c86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,178,165,215,117,80,163,160,207,64,103,2,44,91,95,209,202,227,140,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
