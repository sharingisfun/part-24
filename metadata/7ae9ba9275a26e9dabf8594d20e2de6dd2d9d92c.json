The singles, which were based on a similar series done by rockabilly legend Charlie Feathers in the 1970s, featured some of most incendiary, hyper-charged tunes the band ever cut. From their spastic take on Chain Gang&amp;#039;s &quot;Son Of Sam&quot; to &quot;Ghetto Mom&quot; (the final single from 2002) these seven-inch sides always showcased the band&amp;#039;s full-throttle punk rock side.\n\nNow, for the first time, all five out-of-print singles have been collected in one place on Jukebox Explosion, along with eight previously unheard rarities from the band&amp;#039;s early days that are every bit as action-packed, frantic, and furious. Jukebox Explosion captures one of the most exciting, original, and influential bands to emerge in the 1990s at the absolute peak of their powers. If you dig rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; roll music, this stuff is absolutely essential.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ae9ba9275a26e9dabf8594d20e2de6dd2d9d92c","amp;dn":"Jon+Spencer+Blues+Explosion+-+Jukebox+Explosion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ae9ba9275a26e9dabf8594d20e2de6dd2d9d92c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,233,186,146,117,162,110,157,171,248,89,77,32,226,222,109,210,217,217,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
