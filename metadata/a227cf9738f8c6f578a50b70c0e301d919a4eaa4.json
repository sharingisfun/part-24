A story of the English outlaw Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men, the novel compiles traditional material into a coherent narrative and adapts it for children.[1] The novel is notable for taking the subject of Robin Hood, which had been increasingly popular through the 19th century, in a new direction that influenced later writers, artists, and filmmakers through the next century.[1]\nPlot\n\nThe plot follows Robin Hood as he becomes an outlaw after a conflict with foresters and through his many adventures and run-ins with the law. Each chapter tells a different tale of RobinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s adventures as he romances Maid Marian, recruits Merry Men, resists the authorities, and aids his fellow man. The popular stories of Robin defeating Little John in a fight with staffs, of his besting at the hands of Friar Tuck, and of his collusion with Allan-a-Dale all appear. In the end Robin and his men are pardoned by King Richard Lionheart and his band are incorporated into the kingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s retinue, much to the dismay of the Sheriff of Nottingham.\n\nSummary by Wikipedia.org GNU FDL\n\nFor more informations please visit:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://opencast.de/?p=141&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://opencast.de/?p=141&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a227cf9738f8c6f578a50b70c0e301d919a4eaa4","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+The+Merry+Adventures+of+Robin+Hood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a227cf9738f8c6f578a50b70c0e301d919a4eaa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,39,207,151,56,248,198,245,120,165,11,112,192,227,1,217,25,164,234,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
