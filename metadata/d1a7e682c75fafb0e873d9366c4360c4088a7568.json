So far, all of the people I have given this music to have liked it.\n\nI recently purchased another copy for myself fromsince I had given away my previous copy and missed it. I had sent it to someone in another country who I knew was stressed out and I hoped that the music would help her.\n\nI currently have the music playing in my PC. If you are feeling worried, fearful, or upset, I highly recommend that you get yourself a copy of this CD. The added bonus of this version of the CD which I purchased from Amazon is that it includes both extra music tracks as well as video material. As usual, Amazon provided great service and I thank them for that.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAndreas Vollenweider - Behind the Gardens-Behind the Wall-Under the Tree\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 63 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
