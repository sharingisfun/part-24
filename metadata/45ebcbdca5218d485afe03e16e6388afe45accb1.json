Credit should be given the arrangements by Sean O?Neill, who has cleverly put them together in a very complimentary medley format. Each songs flows very naturally into the next. I would imagine children will especially like the collection, and so will you the next time you toss back a few. An excellent training album for the average American on St. Pats. Think of it as music to get shitfaced by.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45ebcbdca5218d485afe03e16e6388afe45accb1","amp;dn":"Sean+O%5C%27Neill+Band+-+100+Irish+Drinking+Songs+-+Medley+Format","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45ebcbdca5218d485afe03e16e6388afe45accb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,235,203,220,165,33,141,72,90,254,3,225,110,99,136,175,228,90,204,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
