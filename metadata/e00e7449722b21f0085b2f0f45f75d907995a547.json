Safari is available in more than a dozen languages, Adium in more than 20. This is great, but how many of those do you need? Xslimmer allows you to select how many languages you want to preserve in your apps and will remove the rest, recovering lots of precious free space from your disk.\n    Remove unnecessary code from fat binaries. Xslimmer determines which code your machine needs and removes the rest. This is achieved by removing the code inside the Universal Binaries that does not fit with your machine's architecture, a code that never gets executed and just wastes your disk space.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e00e7449722b21f0085b2f0f45f75d907995a547","amp;dn":"Xslimmer+1.9+%5BK%27ed%5D+Mac+OS+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e00e7449722b21f0085b2f0f45f75d907995a547","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,14,116,73,114,43,33,240,8,91,47,15,69,247,93,144,121,149,165,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
