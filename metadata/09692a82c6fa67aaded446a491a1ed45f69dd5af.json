Ui is temporary and may not be intuitive, but the underlying functions should work.\r\nSettings: Added FOV slider\r\nSettings: Added View Distance slider\r\nUser interface tweaks\r\nLoading: Now 1080p-friendly, but still WIP\r\nSwitches: Now back to normal interactor, less confusing\r\nLights: Is now a light bulb, but still WIP\r\nCombine: Changed the icon to better represent &quot;repairing&quot;\r\nUnder-the-hood massive clean up of sprites\r\nOptimizations\r\nIncreased the crappiness of the crappy setting\r\nTweaked quality options. Among other things, it is now possible to disable foliage animations and change view distance.\r\nSplashScreen: Moved initialization call to SplashScreen. We have moved some initialization calls to the splash screen. It might hang a bit on Parabole logo, but it's better than having the game stuck on grey screen.\r\nMainMenu: Removed some useless assets\r\nMainMenu: Reduced view distance\r\nMainMenu: Simplified particle shader Plus dozens of small bug fixes and minor tweaks.\r\nKnown Major Issues / WIP Features\r\nOnly TWO visions/ghosts to find.

Working on it.\r\nThe journal still doesn't work.\r\nThe polaroid does not serve any purpose at the moment.\r\nPlanned for next update\r\nThe mighty Journal!\r\nThe manificient Photography interactor!\r\nMore optimizations YEAH!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09692a82c6fa67aaded446a491a1ed45f69dd5af","amp;dn":"Kona%3A+Day+One+%28Patch+2.3.0.5%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09692a82c6fa67aaded446a491a1ed45f69dd5af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,105,42,130,198,250,103,170,222,212,70,164,145,161,237,69,246,157,213,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
