And once the label got to hear\nsome of the first written versions, they were sold They were\ntoo good to be left lying around. After touching base with\nseveral other Alfa Matrix artists, in no time a second volume\nwas born, featuring the label's well-renowned classic bands, as\nwell as the work of newly-arrived label artists and others who\ndid not make it in time for the previous edition.\n\nTwo years further down the road and here is the second volume\ncovers of what has to be the best synthpop band in history.\nSince 2008, a lot has happened in the DEPECHE MODE camp, tours,\na new album and the band celebrating the 30th anniversary of the\nrelease of their first single. It's all in the spirit of being a\nDEPECHE MODE fan, specifically reflected in the selection of the\ncovered songs...  Compiled by and for DEPECHE MODE fans, &quot;Alfa\nMatrix Re:covered - A Tribute to Depeche Mode Volume 2&quot; will\noffer you once more a very special insight into what makes\nDEPECHE MODE songs so special. Enjoy these interpretations and\nre-discover the beauty of all these classics re:covered by the\nAlfa Matrix stable, offering a diverse sound panel going from\nsynthpop, over old-school electro to melancholic electro rock.\n100% previously unreleased versions\n\nGROUPNOTES\n\nFWYH : FUCK WHAT YOU HEARD, We're all about Family\nDedication, Quality, Respect &amp; LOVE for the music\nAs the years pass, all our motives and objectives\nremain,we want to give the best of dark electronic\ngenres,with the quality deserved for the only true\nunderground scene, the Future is these genres\n\nTo all the artists that we release, some newcomers\n&amp; other established acts: We are sorry if you dont\nunderstand the promotion we do, of your own work,\nbut if you make quality music, we are pretty sure\nthat a lot of people will spend their own money on\nyour art.
