Standard antivirus programs are good at detecting this Malware, but not always good at \n\neffectively removing it. \n\n  \nTrojan Remover is designed to work on Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Windows 7. The program is not \n\ncompatible with any 64bit version of Windows.\n\nThe majority of Virus and Trojan Scanners are well able to detect malicious software - \n\nTrojan Horses, Internet Worms, Adware/Spyware etc. - but are not always very efficient in \n\nremoving them once they have been triggered. \n\nTrojan Remover is designed specifically to disable/remove Malware without the user having to \n\nmanually edit system files or the Registry. The program also removes the additional system \n\nmodifications some Malware carries out which are ignored by standard antivirus and trojan \n\nscanners. \n\nTrojan Remover scans ALL the files loaded at boot time for Adware, Spyware, Remote Access \n\nTrojans, Internet Worms and other malware. Trojan Remover also checks to see if Windows \n\nloads Files/Services which are hidden by Rootkit techniques and warns you if it finds any.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfe71bf906e756473cdda7f36a464d1584db2a52","amp;dn":"Trojan+Remover+v6.8.2+Build+2596","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfe71bf906e756473cdda7f36a464d1584db2a52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,231,27,249,6,231,86,71,60,221,167,243,106,70,77,21,132,219,42,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
