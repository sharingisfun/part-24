It's an introduction to programming book that uses the Python language. Four sample programs are included (they are discussed in the appendix).\n\nI plan on finding a publisher but that will take some time. In the meantime, I am releasing this under the GNU Free Document License as an ebook.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\n(I tried to upload this before but it didn't seem to work. Hopefully this one will.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fe99c2ecf86ae869a668e53ebf6f7f442787f19","amp;dn":"Intro+to+programming+ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fe99c2ecf86ae869a668e53ebf6f7f442787f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,233,156,46,207,134,174,134,154,102,142,83,235,246,247,244,66,120,127,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
