Eight years before astronaut George Taylor fell from the stars...the stars fell on the PLANET OF THE APES! Once the destroyer of human civilization, the Alpha-Omega bomb of yore has slept silent in the dark side of the moon. One mad monk seeks to wake the beast...and all of ape society is at risk. It's a race against time as Doctor Zaius struggles to find an end to the madness that has engulfed all that he knows! Collecting issues 1-4 of the critically acclaimed series from Corinna Bechko (HEATHENTOWN, FEAR ITSELF: THE HOME FRONT) and Gabriel Hardman (HULK, AGENTS OF ATLAS) along with fan-favorite artist Damian Couceiro (INCORRUPTIBLE)!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79fc4682bfb96e858c11ffb67ccb3ab5d736552b","amp;dn":"Planet+of+the+Apes+-+Cataclysm+TPB+%28v1+-+v3%29+%282013+-+2014%29+%28Digi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79fc4682bfb96e858c11ffb67ccb3ab5d736552b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,252,70,130,191,185,110,133,140,17,255,182,124,203,58,181,215,54,85,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
