English psychiatrist and writer Theodore Dalrymple shows that freeing the mind from prejudice is not only impossible, but entails intellectual, moral and emotional dishonesty. The attempt to eradicate prejudice has several dire consequences for the individual and society as a whole.\n\nAuthor: Theodore Dalrymple\nPublisher: Encounter Books\nPublication Date: August 10, 2007\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:988ad946369973538a0834f51444888353f2f654","amp;dn":"Theodore+Dalrymple+-+In+Praise+of+Prejudice+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"988ad946369973538a0834f51444888353f2f654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,138,217,70,54,153,115,83,138,8,52,245,20,68,136,131,83,242,246,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
