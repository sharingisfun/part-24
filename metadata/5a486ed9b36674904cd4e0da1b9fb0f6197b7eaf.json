It DOES include the sound version from the original presentation - i.e. with the sound effects intact.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a486ed9b36674904cd4e0da1b9fb0f6197b7eaf","amp;dn":"The+Hobbit+-+TV+-+1977+-+Music+Soundtracks+Including+Dialogue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a486ed9b36674904cd4e0da1b9fb0f6197b7eaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,72,110,217,179,102,116,144,76,212,224,218,27,159,176,246,25,123,126,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
