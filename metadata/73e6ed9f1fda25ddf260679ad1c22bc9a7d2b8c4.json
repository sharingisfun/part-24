The main character is an unnamed man who is walking up 3rd Avenue. It's a gorgeous evening, and the sky is just changing color from light blue to violet. The man is wearing a light gray suit. He looks like he is in love. The people around him all seem to perceive and respond to this feeling. The man stops at a flower vendor.
