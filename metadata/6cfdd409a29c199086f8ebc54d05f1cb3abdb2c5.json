Each week Crace reduces a new book - anything from a Booker Prize winner to a Nigella cookery book is fair game - to 700 words in a parody of the plot, style, dialogue and themes. Or lack of them. The Digested Read has not just become an institution for readers; it is read and enjoyed by publishers and authors too. So long as it is not their book being digested. A few years ago Crace wrote Brideshead Abbreviated, A Digested Read of the 20th Century. This is the 21st Century. So far.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cfdd409a29c199086f8ebc54d05f1cb3abdb2c5","amp;dn":"The+Digested+Twenty-first+Century+%282014%29+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cfdd409a29c199086f8ebc54d05f1cb3abdb2c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,253,212,9,162,156,25,144,134,248,235,197,77,5,241,203,58,189,178,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
