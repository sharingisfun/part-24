The comic-opera revolutionaries are the suff of stand-up vaudevilee. Don't expect anything more than belly laughs and you'll have a fairly good time.\n\nThis is one of Powell's earliest quota quickies, cheap films designed to fulfill local content laws. The video quality is ROTTEN, but no-one took much care to preserve this stuff.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14f29382d5933e95f17443dc1ff6c744750ef601","amp;dn":"His+Lordship+%281932%29+Michael+Powell+musical+comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14f29382d5933e95f17443dc1ff6c744750ef601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,242,147,130,213,147,62,149,241,116,67,220,31,246,199,68,117,14,246,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
