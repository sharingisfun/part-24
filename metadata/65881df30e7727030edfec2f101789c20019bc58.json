Later, he borrowed his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar and taught himself the chords he had memorised from watching his brother play. Music from the all-time greats, from Led Zeppelin to the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, Metallica and even Chris de Burgh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the records enjoyed by his family Ã¢â‚¬â€œ helped to shape his eclectic tastes at this young age.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“My sound is very much about blending and collaboration,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Delinger explains. This refers not only to his willingness to learn from the contemporary bands he admires, such as Daughtry, AC/DC and even punk rock outfit Good Charlotte, but specifically to his belief that artists can, and should, develop strength from each other Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hence the name of his album, Never Walk Alone.\n\nAlthough Never Walk Alone is a stunning showcase of the talents of this gifted singer, songwriter and musician, he is quick to give credit to the other artists whom, he maintains, have enhanced it through their contributions. These include Michael Naranjo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who also produced the album Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on bass, Ryan Schnettler on guitar and ChromiumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gerard on drums. Delinger, meanwhile, wrote each of the songs, provides vocals and also plays guitar.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not surprising, then, that the songs will find resonance with a wide audience, particularly as Delinger says he has taken the essence of classic rock, repackaging it to find popularity amongst younger listeners. The result is an album that has something for everyone, and will be a special treat for fans of soft rock with a hint of blues and strong guitar melodies.\n\nThis is not the first time he will be delighting a multitude of fans: his distinctive voice first caught the publicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention when, in 2002, he participated in the Ethno Music Festival in Sweden. He has since performed at a number of leading South African cultural festivals and theater productions.\n\nALBUMS:\n\nNever Walk Alone (2010)\nRemember the Hits (Vol 2) (2013)(Contains some of the best covers ever created!)\n\nALL TRACKS IN MP3 FORMAT, 256kbps\n\nSCANNED WITH ESET SMART SECURITY: NO THREATS OR INFECTIONS\n\nPLEASE SEED !!\n\nENJOY !!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65881df30e7727030edfec2f101789c20019bc58","amp;dn":"Jon+Delinger+-+2+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65881df30e7727030edfec2f101789c20019bc58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,136,29,243,14,119,39,3,14,223,236,47,16,23,137,194,0,25,188,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
