The repertoire tended toward orchestral showpieces, doubtless intended to show off the then-new digital recording technology.\n\nPerhaps because Maazel never recorded a complete symphony cycle, this performance of Shostakovich's 5th symphony is not listed in music guides as a &quot;reference&quot; recording for the work. It should be. For me, this performance contains many of the best aspects of Stokowski's, Haitink's, and Bernstein's approaches, with spectacular orchestra playing and far superior sound. Personally, this is my favorite Shostakovich 5th, particularly for the searing third movement.\n\nI initially heard this recording of The Rite of Spring on an LP. The dynamics were not compressed and some of the louder passages literally bounced the needle out of the groove. Maazel doesn't tamper with the orchestration here, but his tempos are all over the map, with rubatos and ritardandos liberally applied (which is poles apart from Stravinsky's intentions). The thought of a ballet troupe having to dance to this interpretation boggles the mind. The beginning of the Glorification of the Chosen One is played at approximately HALF the tempo indicated in the score. This is certainly an exciting performance, but because of Maazel's eccentricities, I cannot recommend it as a reference version.\n\nSpectacular as the sound is here, Telarc has reissued these recordings (with different couplings) on SACD Hybrid discs.\n\nwww.amazon.com\n\nArtists: Dmitri Shostakovich, Igor Stravinsky, Lorin Maazel, The Cleveland Orchestra\nRelease: Symphony No. 5 Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The Rite Of Spring\nDiscogs: http://www.discogs.com/release/3157472\nLabel: Telarc\nCatalog#: CD-82001\nReleased: 1993\nStyle: Classical, Modern\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1.
