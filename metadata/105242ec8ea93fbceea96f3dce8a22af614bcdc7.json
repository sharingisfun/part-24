Because the construction and lace patterns are simple variations on a theme, lace-knitting skills are progressively honed and developed. The sequence of work allows the knitter to observe how the lace pattern develops and then to explore its options for further fabrication. Clearly illustrated techniques and step-by-step blocking and finishing directions ensure first-time success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:105242ec8ea93fbceea96f3dce8a22af614bcdc7","amp;dn":"Angels%3A+A+Knitter%27s+Dozen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"105242ec8ea93fbceea96f3dce8a22af614bcdc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,82,66,236,142,169,63,188,238,169,111,61,206,138,34,175,97,75,205,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
