Mount it or burn it then watch it but don't sleep thru it. It is all there with menus ect. This season they include the directors commentary and a few more cheesy bonus features or specials. Except for this DVD, Season 9 brings alternate language tracks and subtitles and more cheezy bonuses.. I'm trying every few days to upload another DVD.. So far so good. No I take that back, I'm dicken around again.. ;)\nAny problems kindly keep them to yourself or ask someone who can help.\n\nSpanish and French subs I believe\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99fb029969a800894bbf2b9a9ec51b248d9fd88c","amp;dn":"Stargate+SG1+Season+9+Disk+3+of+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99fb029969a800894bbf2b9a9ec51b248d9fd88c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,251,2,153,105,168,0,137,75,191,43,154,158,197,27,36,141,159,216,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
