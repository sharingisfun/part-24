Play a song, click the Genius button, and iTunes creates a playlist of other songs from your library that go great together. Genius playlists help you discover songs in your library you never knew you had ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and rediscover forgotten favorites.\n\nGenius Sidebar\n\nWhile you reacquaint yourself with the music you already own, let Genius introduce you to new music youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll love. As you select songs in your library, the Genius sidebar displays songs from the iTunes Store that go great with it. The Genius sidebar wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t recommend songs already in your library, and you can preview and buy recommended songs directly from the sidebar.\n\nGrid View\n\nSee your iTunes library in a new way. Select Albums in Grid View and iTunes 8 displays your entire music library using cover art. Select Artists, Genres, or Composers and iTunes automatically creates groups of albums based on your selection. Simply skim across a group to see the albums inside, and start playing an album with a single click. Movies, TV shows, podcasts, and audiobooks look great in Grid View, too.\n\n\nHD TV Shows\n\nPurchase select episodes of your favorite TV shows in high definition for just $2.99. Or get the whole season in HD with a Season Pass. And when you buy HD, iTunes doubles your viewing pleasure: You also get an iPod-ready version with a file size and resolution that&amp;#039;s ideal for smaller screens.\n\nEnhanced Accessibility\n\niTunes 8 is now screen reader friendly on both Mac and PC. Manage your iTunes library using VoiceOver in Mac OS X Leopard or Window-Eyes for Windows XP and Windows Vista. Or use your screen reader to purchase or download content from the iTunes Store ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ including iTunes U.\n\nNew Visualizer\n\nTurn on the new Visualizer and lose yourself in a 3D-scape of spheres, ribbons, and lights that pulsate to the beat and tempo of the song youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re playing.
