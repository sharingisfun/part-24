Produced by Barry Poynter (Living Sacrifice, Zao) and mixed by Hate Eternal/ former Morbid Angel guitarist Erik Rutan (Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under, Through the Eyes of the Dead), Dead Alive serves as Soul EmbracedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s proper reintroduction to the metal community. The return of Soul Embraced has been a long time coming. Rocky Gray is now back behind the lead guitar, having spent the last few years recording and touring with the multi-platinum hard rock band Evanescence. Gray has reunited with his close friend Chad Moore, whose vocals recall the best of Carcass and At the Gates. Lance Garvin (GrayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Living Sacrifice bandmate) is back behind the kit. The bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s founding members, who formed the band in 1997 after the dissolution of Shredded Corpse, are joined by new bass player Jeff Bowie and new guitarist Devin Castle. Dead Alive is the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first full-length release since 2003 and is by far their most brutal and yet most diverse offering. Look for them on the road in 2008.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.soulembraced.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.soulembraced.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:513996b5533d8588303a862e58907cc45a5ee5d0","amp;dn":"Soul+Embraced+-+Dead+Alive+%282008%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"513996b5533d8588303a862e58907cc45a5ee5d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,57,150,181,83,61,133,136,48,58,134,46,88,144,124,196,90,94,229,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
