They can bust up a bar or bust out of jail drop in on a brothel or get the drop on a gunslinger. It's all safe: the park's lifelike androids are programmed never to harm the customers. But not all droids are getting with the program. Richard Benjamin and James Brolin portray pals confronted by a simulated reality turned real. And Yul Brynner is their stalking spur-jangling nemesis. It's man versus machine - in a tomorrow that isn't big enough for the both of them.\n\n  Starring: Yul Brynner, Richard Benjamin, James Brolin, Norman Bartold, Alan Oppenheimer.\n\n  Directed by: Michael Crichton. \n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 29min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 316","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:285cd7af6f221e6012850143ebb8d193325069fb","amp;dn":"Westworld+%281973%29+%28Yul+Brynner%2C+Richard+Benjamin%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"285cd7af6f221e6012850143ebb8d193325069fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,92,215,175,111,34,30,96,18,133,1,67,235,184,209,147,50,80,105,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
