For most of its existence, Everclear consisted of Art Alexakis (lead guitar, lead vocals), Craig Montoya (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Greg Eklund (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Eklund replaced original drummer Scott Cuthbert in 1994. Montoya and Eklund departed the band in 2003, but Alexakis has continued the band. Current members include Dave &quot;Davey&quot; French (rhythm guitar), Josh Crawley (keyboards), Sam Hudson (bass guitar), and Tommy Stewart (drums, percussion). \n\n\n\nSparkle and Fade\n\n\nSparkle and Fade is the second album by Everclear, released on May 23, 1995. It was their first album to be released exclusively on Capitol Records; their previous effort, World of Noise, was re-released on Capitol after its introduction through the Portland, Oregon based label, Tim/Kerr Records.\n\nThe album's lead single, &quot;Heroin Girl,&quot; performed well on college radio but did not gain significant mainstream airplay. That would be granted to their follow up, &quot;Santa Monica,&quot; which effectively put Everclear on the map. The next two singles, &quot;Heartspark Dollarsign&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel Like A Whore,&quot; would have moderate rotation, but the band wouldn't gain major success again until their next album, So Much for the Afterglow.\n\nThe cover art to Sparkle and Fade features childhood pictures of the three members of the band, with bassist Craig Montoya on the left, guitarist/singer Art Alexakis in the middle, and drummer Greg Eklund on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n Tracks:\n\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Electra Made Me Blind&quot; (Alexakis, Cuthbert, Montoya) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43 \n2.\t&quot;Heroin Girl&quot; (Alexakis, Cuthbert, Montoya) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:23 \n3.\t&quot;You Make Me Feel Like a Whore&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:47 \n4.\t&quot;Santa Monica&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11 \n5.\t&quot;Summerland&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42 \n6.\t&quot;Strawberry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35 \n7.\t&quot;Heartspark Dollarsign&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52 \n8.\t&quot;The Twistinside&quot; (Alexakis, Cuthbert, Montoya) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37 \n9.\t&quot;Her Brand New Skin&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:02 \n10.\t&quot;Nehalem&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:53 \n11.\t&quot;Queen of the Air&quot; (Alexakis, Cuthbert, Montoya) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59 \n12.\t&quot;Pale Green Stars&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17 \n13.\t&quot;Chemical Smile&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:49 \n14.\t&quot;My Sexual Life&quot; (Alexakis, Cuthbert, Montoya) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51 \n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:626a184e4f7d4829bda62e57a5a88e4eb872d49c","amp;dn":"Everclear+-+Sparkle+and+Fade+1995+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"626a184e4f7d4829bda62e57a5a88e4eb872d49c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,106,24,78,79,125,72,41,189,166,46,87,165,168,142,78,184,114,212,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
