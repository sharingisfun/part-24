They are named Charlotte and Gavin, after Charlotte Church and Gavin Henson. The lambs are a Charollais-Welsh cross.[2] Charlotte has been killed by an unknown animal, possibly a big cat.[3] Gavin escaped slaughter because he was treated with antibiotics. \nFast food is the target of the underlying campaign, proving that fast food doesn&amp;#039;t have to come out of a microwave. \nThe amateur brigades are competing to cook in Gordon&amp;#039;s restaurant at Claridge&amp;#039;s. The brigade with the most amount of paying customers at the end of the series, will win. \nThe series is running a competition to find a new &quot;Fanny Cradock&quot;, and the winner will get a regular slot on the show.
