Alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett, with a\nspiritual energy mirroring a significant influence, John Coltrane, intended to\nuse Beyond the Wall as an opportunity to record with pianist McCoy Tyner, with\nwhom he's shared the bandstand on occasion. Though a scheduling conflict\nprevented Tyner from participating, his spiritÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and that of his late\nemployerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½looms large over the project. The result echoes the scope of\nlarger-scale Tyner projects like Asante (Blue Note\n, 1970) and the fierce\nmodality of middle-period Coltrane.\n\nWith Tyner unavailable, Garrett's choice of Mulgrew Miller was inevitable. With\nso many pianists citing Bill Evans as a primary influence, Miller has defined\nhis career by looking to Tyner for his primary inspiration. Garrett had already\ntailored his writing on Beyond the Wall to Tyner's distinctive language, so\nMiller gets to pay tribute but, with a more muscular sound, still speak with his\nown voice. And direct links are forged on most of the disc, to both Tyner and\nColtrane, with the appearances of tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders and\nvibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson.\n\nBeyond the Wall came about because of a 2005 visit to mainland China, inspired\nby Garrett's longstanding interest in the nation's culture and\nspirituality. He's always been a deeply passionate player who can speak volumes\nwith a single note, and the relentless intensity of the majority of this record\nmakes it the most purely cathartic album he's ever recorded.\n\nWhether it's the out-of-time opening to &quot;Calling,&quot; which resolves into a slow\n6/8 vamp where Sanders and Garrett solo in tandem, or the up-tempo burn of the\ntitle track, everyone is firing on all cylinders. And while the route through\nTyner must inherently lead back to Coltrane, Garrett's headsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½more fully-realized\nthan Coltrane's relatively short themesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½echo Tyner's more compositional approach\nto setting context for improvisation.\n\nThere is some respite, specifically &quot;Realization: Marching Towards the Light),&quot;\nwhere a sampled chorus is the pulse that drives the song, and the chamber-like\n&quot;Tsunami Song,&quot; featuring Garrett on piano and a haunting melody played by\nGuowei Wang on the bowed, two-stringed erhu.\n\nFrom there it's a gradual buildup from the light funk of &quot;Kiss to the Skies&quot; to\nthe finale, &quot;May Peace Be Upon Them.&quot; &quot;Kiss&quot; is one of four songs to feature\nwordless vocals and, while they're interesting the first few times around, they\nultimately feel superfluous. &quot;May Peace&quot; is curiously ambiguous, beginning in a\ngentle space but leading to an out-of-time whirlpool of sound featuring Garrett\nat his most visceral.\n\nIt's hard to find fault with the deeply emotional ride of Beyond the Wall\nexcept, perhaps, in its unrelenting seriousness. Still, with a cast of players\nthis strong, one can forgive its earnestness and revel in performances\nthat\nbring Tyner's and Coltrane's innovations into the 21st Century.\n\nEn castellano:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fba1ed70bb9fbc7e579a5cafb5a6268dfcc4a2c","amp;dn":"Kenny+Garrett+-+Beyond+The+Wall+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fba1ed70bb9fbc7e579a5cafb5a6268dfcc4a2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,186,30,215,11,185,251,199,229,121,165,202,251,90,98,104,223,204,74,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
