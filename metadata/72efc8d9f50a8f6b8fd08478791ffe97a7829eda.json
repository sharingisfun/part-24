Pretty god damn sure we won't\nsee any LiNE for this, doubt we'll get any full audio up until retail drops either.\n&gt; First 5 minutes of the release are Russian dubbed. (You can still clearly hear the English \naudio in the background over the Russian audio though). After credits scene is also in\nRussian. Audio is a little meh, some of you won't mind it, some of you will hate it and some \nof you will bitch about it. Not our best release but we simply have no time and we just \nhad to put this out there.\n\nOn a personal note; saw this at the cinema, I reccommend you watch it under the influence of\na heavy amount of your favourite drug/alcohoic beverage. You may understand it that way...\n\nWe wish we could release more often, but we simply can't. We love you all. &lt;3\n\nGreetz: To everybody keeping things alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72efc8d9f50a8f6b8fd08478791ffe97a7829eda","amp;dn":"Movie+43+2013+R5+READNFO+XviD-HELLRAZ0R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72efc8d9f50a8f6b8fd08478791ffe97a7829eda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,239,200,217,245,10,143,107,143,208,132,120,121,31,254,151,167,130,158,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
