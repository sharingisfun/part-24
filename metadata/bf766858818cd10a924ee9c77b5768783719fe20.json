A crime prevention\nofficer is a public servant who possesses police\npowers. A loss prevention manager or security director\nworks in the private sector and receives whatever\nauthority he or she possesses from an employer but\nis not granted the powers of a public law enforcement\nofficer. The job descriptions of these two positions,\nhowever, are quite similar and the skills\nrequired identical. Prevention is the focus in both\ncases. The crime prevention officer and the loss prevention\nmanager are expected to assess crime vulnerabilityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nno matter whether it is of a residential\narea, small business, college campus, hospital, or a\ncorporationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and recommend cost-effective security\nmeasures. Security problems are common to both the\npublic and the private sectors and so, too, are\nsolutions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf766858818cd10a924ee9c77b5768783719fe20","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Loss+Prevention+and+Crime+Prevention","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf766858818cd10a924ee9c77b5768783719fe20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,118,104,88,129,140,209,10,146,78,233,199,123,87,104,120,55,25,254,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
