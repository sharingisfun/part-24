Album dedicated to Tom Nevins.\n\n On their fifth and most accomplished album, Rockin' in the Weary Land, Donna the Buffalo present another batch of eclectic folk-rock with an upbeat groove and meaningful lyrics. The songs' topics range from preserving Florida's wetlands on &quot;Seminole Wind&quot; to &quot;Mr. King,&quot; a tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. Musically, Rockin' in the Weary Land includes country (&quot;All the Time&quot;), reggae (&quot;It Will Be Right&quot;), cajun (&quot;Mr. King&quot;), and zydeco (&quot;Tides of Time&quot;), and surrounds it all with Donna the Buffalo's signature danceable grooves. Singer/songwriters Jeb Puryear, Tara Nevins, and Joe Thrift all contribute fine vocals, lyrics and playing, and with the rest of the Buffalos alongside, they deliver a rollicking and thoughtful good time with Rockin' in the Weary Land.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/06/20/donna-the-buffalo/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e99a8693b83eae8cdc7686b90f6164b59740cba5","amp;dn":"Donna+the+Buffalo...Rockin%5C%27+in+the+Weary+Land%281998%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e99a8693b83eae8cdc7686b90f6164b59740cba5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,154,134,147,184,62,174,140,220,118,134,185,15,97,100,181,151,64,203,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
