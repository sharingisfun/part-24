Adams Sitney, &quot;Eyes Upside Down: Visionary Filmmakers and the Heritage of Emerson&quot;\n Publisher: Oxford University Press | ISBN: 0195331141 | edition 2008 | PDF | 433 pages | 1,25 mb\n\n Sitney analyzes in detail the work of eleven American avant-garde filmmakers as heirs to the aesthetics of exhilaration and innovative vision articulated by Ralph Waldo Emerson and explored by John Cage, Charles Olson and Gertrude Stein. The films discussed span the sixty years since the Second World War. With three chapters each devoted to Stan Brakhage and Robert Beavers, two each to Hollis Frampton and Jonas Mekas, and single chapters on Marie Menken, Ian Hugo, Andrew Noren, Warren Sonbert, Su Friedrich, Ernie Gehr, and Abigail Child, Eyes Upside Down is the fruit of Sitney's lifelong study of visionary aspirations in the American avant-garde cinema.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0a1eae089fa5ad3ced90cc0db79e1e4f00ff386","amp;dn":"+Visionary+Filmmakers+and+the+Heritage+of+Emerson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0a1eae089fa5ad3ced90cc0db79e1e4f00ff386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,161,234,224,137,250,90,211,206,217,12,192,219,121,225,228,240,15,243,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
