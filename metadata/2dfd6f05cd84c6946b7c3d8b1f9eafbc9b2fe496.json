Addressing his fifteen-year-old namesake on the one hundredth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, Baldwin wrote: â€œYou know and I know, that the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too soon.â€\r\n\r\nAward-winning author Jesmyn Ward knows that Baldwinâ€™s words ring as true as ever today. In response, she has gathered short essays, memoir, and a few essential poems to engage the question of race in the United States. And she has turned to some of her generationâ€™s most original thinkers and writers to give voice to their concerns.\r\n\r\nThe Fire This Time is divided into three parts that shine a light on the darkest corners of our history, wrestle with our current predicament, and envision a better future. Of the eighteen pieces, ten were written specifically for this volume.\r\n\r\nIn the fifty-odd years since Baldwinâ€™s essay was published, entire generations have dared everything and made significant progress. But the idea that we are living in the post-Civil Rights era, that we are a â€œpost-racialâ€ society is an inaccurate and harmful reflection of a truth the country must confront. Baldwinâ€™s â€œfire next timeâ€ is now upon us, and it needs to be talked about.\r\n\r\nContributors include Carol Anderson, Jericho Brown, Garnette Cadogan, Edwidge Danticat, Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, Mitchell S.
