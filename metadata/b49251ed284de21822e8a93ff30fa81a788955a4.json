But while many have suspected the existence of these projects, the details have long been preserved.\n\nMIND CONTROL blows the lid off years of chilling experiments, drawing on documents reluctantly released through the Freedom of Information Act and interviews with some of the victims, including a woman whose past was literally taken away.\n\nHear from John Marks, the author of In Search of the Manchurian Candidate, who broke the story of the CIA's abuses by unraveling the mysteries contained in financial records. All the other records pertaining to the experiments were destroyed by the agency in an attempt to prevent the details from ever being known.\n\nAfter viewing this important program, you'll have reason to wonder about your own thoughts...\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWar is a racket - The Pathology of Power and American propensity for war:\nThis video gets off to a slow start, but give it a minute or two.  Interesting story about Cousins...  He wrote a massively important book in 1987 called &quot;The Pathology of Power.&quot; Interestingly, it fell off the map, but the news media went into overdrive promoting his less important books... (Maybe a buyoff?).  \n\nOne of the great lessons of this book references after World War I when the world was sick to death of war, the munitions makers got together to make sure that big wars continued. They organized to buy Congress and the media and they made sure that the war mentality was THE mentality.  It's well recorded that it was not necessary for the U.S. to have dropped the atomic bomb on Japan as they were already going to surrender.  Intentionally misleading the public, the U.S. had ulterior motives for blasting Japan with a nuke!\n\nSome gems:\n&quot;War is a double suicide.&quot;\n&quot;The fleecing of the American people in the name of security&quot;\n&quot;Under the name of security, our security is threatened.&quot;\n&quot;What makes you think that the people who can't be trusted with the wealth of the American people can be trusted with their security.&quot;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVictoria, Nigeria - IDOP 2013:\nThis 5-minute IDOP video focuses on Victoria and Rejoice, two teenage girls who live in Gombe, Nigeria.

Supermarkets are flooded with GMO products, but how safe is it to eat them? Tasty and beautiful, they are produced with intervention unprecedented in history. Gene manipulation: how appropriate is it? Does it contribute to solving the food crisis on the planet? Or will humanity have to pay a costly price for meddling with what is not theirs. We talk to Jeffrey M. Smith, GMO researcher from the Institute for Responsible Technology.  A large number of case studies show that MD's who prescribe non-GMO products to patients' diets have documented a tremendous decrease in various diseases, cancers and etc.!  (That alone should be cause of concern.) \n\nMonsanto GMO uses the new and improved FAKE SCIENCE to intentionally mislead the public and achieve their goal of global dominance and servitude. Simply utilizing proven concepts in the deceptive tactics of corporate scientific authorship learned from the Drug and Tabacco (Cigarette) Companies of the past, Monsanto increases agricultural dependence and public indocrintation. Money buys Congress and the Court Legislative System to help impose and sustain their monopoly - just as Cigarette Companies did from the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's. While other nations, like in the UK, have banned all GMO products, the United States remains obedient and submissive to the Corporate Giant and helps censor the devasting consequences of using GMO products form public awareness. \n\nHowever unlike cigarettes, GMO poisoning is genetically passed onto the genes of our children; this is where the real problem arises. Not one of simply poisoning those in the present, but all future generations which inherit and compound the GMO mutations from their parents as they grow and will more likely cause irreversible damage in the form of much greater increase in cancers, diseases, and deformities. Nowadays after decades of overt deception, Tobacco is widely known among the public to cause cancer and other problems. How long is it going to take the public to wise up to the Monsanto GMO problem and at what cost to them and their loved ones?  The choice is yours, not one for just yourself, but all future generations!  So choose wisely and stand up against the GMO problem!!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOther Featured Videos include...\nHal Lindsey Report Faith in the Military 9-13-13\nHelen Kurdin -  Videotaped Statement asking Canadian Prime Minister to Stop Mind Control Weapons Use\nPresidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues 2011-03-01\nPresidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues May 18-19-2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b49251ed284de21822e8a93ff30fa81a788955a4","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Wars+and+Rumors+of+Wars+-+30+-+Covert+Implantation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b49251ed284de21822e8a93ff30fa81a788955a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,146,81,237,40,77,226,24,34,232,169,63,243,15,168,26,120,137,85,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
