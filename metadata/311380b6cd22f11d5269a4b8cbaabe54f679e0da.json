While the second side contained songs that had been worked up by the band in concert and rehearsal, the first side was all new material, written by leader Bryan Ferry at a sojourn in a Derbyshire cottage.\nAnd what material it was Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do The StrandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, an ode to a fictional dance which ran through a catalogue of dance crazes that was to become a live favourite; the breathtaking Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beauty QueenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ established Ferry in his frequently-returned-to role as night life commentator; Ã¢â‚¬Å“In Every Dream Home A HeartacheÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a still-bizarre ode to an inflatable doll, is the moment where form and function unite Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the group create a dense soundtrack for FerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unhinged ramblings. The spirit of experimentation is never far away Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Brian EnoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stamp is all over the record, warping the sounds and adding tension to the repetitive drone of the second side stand-out Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Bogus ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nSoon after the release of For Your Pleasure (housed in another stunning Nick De Ville-directed sleeve), the tensions between Eno and Ferry had come to a head; Eno embarked on his increasingly avant-garde solo career while Ferry guided Roxy Music ever closer to the mainstream with a series of fascinating albums, each less arty than the last.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:311380b6cd22f11d5269a4b8cbaabe54f679e0da","amp;dn":"Roxy+Music+For+Your+Pleasure+%28Japanese+mini+vinyl+cd+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"311380b6cd22f11d5269a4b8cbaabe54f679e0da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,19,128,182,205,34,241,29,82,105,164,184,203,170,190,84,246,121,224,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
