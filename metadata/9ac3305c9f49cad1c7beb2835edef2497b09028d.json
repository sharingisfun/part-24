Two controversial pastors address issues the church won't face, calling us to restore grace as the center of the Christian life. \n\no In If Grace Is True, Pastors Philip Gulley and James Mulholland revealed their belief that God will save every person. They now explore the implications of this belief, and its power to change every area of our lives. They attempt to answer one question: If we took God's love seriously, what would our world look like? \n\nGulley and Mulholland argue that what we believe is crucial and dramatically affects the way we live and interact in the world. Beliefs have power. The belief in a literal hell where people suffer eternally has often been used by the Church to justify hate and violence, which contradicts what Jesus taught about love and grace. The authors present a new vision for our personal, religious, and corporate lives, exploring what our world would be like if we based our existence on the foundational truth that God loves every person. \n\nGulley and Mulholland boldly address many controversial issues people in the pews have wondered about but churches have been unwilling to tackle. For too long, the Christian tradition has been steeped in negativity, exclusion, and judgment. Gulley and Mulholland usher us into a new ageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“an age where grace and love are allowed to reign.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ac3305c9f49cad1c7beb2835edef2497b09028d","amp;dn":"If+God+Is+Love%3A+Rediscovering+Grace+in+an+Ungracious+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ac3305c9f49cad1c7beb2835edef2497b09028d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,195,48,92,159,73,202,209,199,190,178,131,94,222,242,73,123,9,2,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
