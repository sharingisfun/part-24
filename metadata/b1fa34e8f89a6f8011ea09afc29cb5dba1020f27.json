He also helped Chuck Berry get his first record contract.\nHis 1958 tour of England marked possibly the first time amplified, modern urban blues was heard there, although on his first\n tour he was the only one amplified. His backing was provided by Englishman Chris Barber's trad jazz group.\n (One critic retreated to the toilets to write his review because he found the band so loud).\nHis use of amplification is cited as, &quot;the technological missing link between Delta Blues and Rock 'N' Roll.&quot;This is underlined\n in a 1968 article in Rolling Stone magazine: Ã¢â‚¬Å“There was a difference between MuddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instrumental work and that of House and\n Johnson, however, and the crucial difference was the result of WatersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ use of the electric guitar on his Aristocrat sides;\n he had taken up the instrument shortly after moving to Chicago in 1943.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n Muddy Waters Ã¢â‚¬Å½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In Memoriam\nLabel:Chess Ã¢â‚¬Å½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ DLP207\nFormat:2 Ãƒâ€” Vinyl, LP, Compilation\nCountry:Finland\nReleased:1986\nGenre:Blues \n\n============================================\n\nTracklist\n\n\nA1 \t\tRollin' Stone \t3:00 \t\nA2 \t\tI Can't Be Satisfied \t2:41 \t\nA3 \t\tRollin' &amp; Tumblin' (Part II) \t2:31 \t\nA4 \t\tKind Hearted Woman \t2:34 \t\nA5 \t\tLouisiana Blues \t2:49 \t\nA6 \t\tLong Distance Call \t2:39 \t\nA7 \t\tShe Moves Me \t2:55 \t\nB1 \t\tI'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man \t2:44 \t\nB2 \t\tI Just Wanna Make Love To You \t3:01 \t\nB3 \t\tI'm Ready \t3:02 \t\nB4 \t\tHoney Bee \t3:20 \t\nB5 \t\tI Want You To Love Me \t3:01 \t\nB6 \t\t40 Days &amp; 40 Nights \t2:50 \t\nB7 \t\tBaby Please Don't Go \t3:01 \t\nC1 \t\tManish Boy \t2:30 \t\nC2 \t\tLook What You've Done \t2:20 \t\nC3 \t\tThe Same Thing \t2:35 \t\nC4 \t\tLet's Spend The Night Togehter \t3:00 \t\nC5 \t\tLay Away Plan \t2:54 \t\nC6 \t\tMemphis \t2:38 \t\nC7 \t\tMy Home Is In The Delta \t3:58 \t\nD1 \t\tRock Me - Live - \t4:20 \t\nD2 \t\tWhat Is That She Got \t4:30 \t\nD3 \t\tYou Don't Have To Go \t3:25 \t\nD4 \t\tStrange Woman \t5:00 \t\nD5 \t\tBlow Wind Blow \t4:30 \t\nD6 \t\tCountry Boy \t4:58 \t\nD7 \t\tGot My Mojo Working \t3:39 \n\n=============================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 2.05 GB\nAlbum                                    : In Memoriam\nTrack name/Total                         : 28\nPerformer                                : Muddy Waters\nRecorded date                            : 1986\n\n===============================================\n\nAudio\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 511 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1fa34e8f89a6f8011ea09afc29cb5dba1020f27","amp;dn":"Muddy+Waters+-+In+Memoriam+%282LP%29+%281986%29+Flac%5B24+Bit+96KHz+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1fa34e8f89a6f8011ea09afc29cb5dba1020f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,250,52,232,248,154,111,128,17,234,9,175,194,156,181,219,161,2,15,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
