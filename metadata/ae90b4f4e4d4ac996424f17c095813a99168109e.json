Almost overnight, November 9 became one of the most significant dates in global collective memory, as well as a signal event in German national history. This book examines the consequences of the fall of the Wall: the physical barrier, its demise, and how it has been mediated in film and television; how the city and nation that had been torn asunder now struggle to reunite; how old and new minorities are being socially and politically integrated; and how a new European identity emerges in the post-Wall era.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae90b4f4e4d4ac996424f17c095813a99168109e","amp;dn":"The+German+Wall++-+Fallout+in+Europe+%282011%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae90b4f4e4d4ac996424f17c095813a99168109e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,144,180,244,228,212,172,153,100,36,241,124,9,88,19,169,145,104,16,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
