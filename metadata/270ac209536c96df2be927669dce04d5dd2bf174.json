Evolutionary theory, like all scientific theories, is a means to understanding the natural world. Understanding Evolution is intended for undergraduate students in the life sciences, biology teachers or anyone wanting a basic introduction to evolutionary theory. Covering core concepts and the structure of evolutionary explanations, it clarifies both what evolution is about and why so many people find it difficult to grasp. The book provides an introduction to the major concepts and conceptual obstacles to understanding evolution, including the development of Darwin's theory, and a detailed presentation of the most important evolutionary concepts. Bridging the gap between the concepts and conceptual obstacles, Understanding Evolution presents evolutionary theory with a clarity and vision students will quickly appreciate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:270ac209536c96df2be927669dce04d5dd2bf174","amp;dn":"Understanding+Evolution+%282014%29+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"270ac209536c96df2be927669dce04d5dd2bf174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,10,194,9,83,108,150,223,43,233,39,102,157,206,4,213,221,43,241,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
