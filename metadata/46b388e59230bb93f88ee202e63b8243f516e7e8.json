After several lineup changes in the early days, the addition of Mo Clifford, Kenneth Bell and Joey Afonso saw the band reach new heights of creativity and stability. Drawing on many influences including Metallica, Alice In Chains, Black Sabbath, Pantera and Mastodon the band fuses groove laden, hard hitting riffs with powerful vocals and pounding drums.\nThe most notable successes to date include a 2010 European Tour supporting Fozzy and Stuck Mojo.\nThe tour included dates in France, Spain, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic and Hungary. During this run the band gained many fans and also some invaluable experience which added to their already very professional approach.\nMost recently the band have completed their debut album titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“16 MinutesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The album was recorded in Sonic Cottage Studios Ireland and mixed and mastered by Jacob Hansen (Volbeat, Doro, Amaranthe) at Hansen Studios in Denmark. Ã¢â‚¬Å“16 MinutesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a powerful yet melodic album which shows off the bands songwriting at its best.\n\nBlack Svan have been steadily building hype around their first album release, 16 Minutes. Loaded with 10 tracks, the album is finally here.\nWelcome to the re-birth of Irish heavy metal.\nBlack Svan have seen moderate success since their formation in 2009, having toured with bands including Stuck Mojo and Fozzy across the United Kingdom and Europe. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve even played alongside one of the leading members of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, Diamond Head. Sharing a stage with these names, plus others, has gained the band a following which spans not just Ireland, but the UK and Europe as well. After gaining invaluable experience on stage, Black Svan opted to enter the studio and record their first full-length album, Ã¢â‚¬â„¢16 MinutesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nYou could say that, bar a handful of exceptions, the Irish heavy metal scene has been fairly quiet over the last few years. Though there are hundreds of Irish bands performing night after night for their local venues, the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s metal fans have been lulled into a deep sleep as they await the next breakout band to take charge. Black SvanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s frontman Keith Caffrey urges you to Ã¢â‚¬Å“wake upÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as the band open their album with Ã¢â‚¬ËœRetributionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. An excellent choice for the opening track, the band effortlessly launch into a song that shows us their ability to be aggressive and loud yet melodic at the same time. This is something of a contrast of the track that follows.\n\n\nimage\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœBleed Me DryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has a much grittier tone to it than its predecessor. Kenneth Bell opens this one with a slick bass riff and is quickly joined by the guitar-wielding duo Jagger Murray and Mo Clifford. This blistering riff is complimented by an insanely quick, machine gun-like double bass drum beat played by drummer Joey Afonso. The songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s climax comes courtesy of Jack NicholsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character from The Shining. We hear a sound-byte of the famous quote from the film, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not gonna hurt youÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, before Murray jumps into a guitar solo that would fit perfectly into the work of SlipknotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jim Root.\n\nFollowing this is a song that stands high above the majority of the others in this reviewerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opinion. Ã¢â‚¬ËœDream ForeverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ begins with a haunting introduction led by Caffrey showcasing his skillful vocal range. When needs be, he is more than capable to recite a sweet, melodic verse. The band waste no time in getting back to their main style, though. An immaculate drum beat opens the door for the full band to come in with yet another dark, fast-paced effort that shows off all the membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ abilities. The real star of the show here though is Caffrey. From his sweet opening to the aggressive, powerful growls in the main section of the track, he has proven to be a worthy frontman of a band holding this much talent.\n\nThe albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title track is an open invitation to the mosh-pit for concert goers. This songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intro just makes you want to jump right into the center of a crowd and go absolutely mental. Ã¢â‚¬â„¢16 MinutesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a single just waiting to happen, any metal fan will adore the tuneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dynamic changes and the short, yet sweet, guitar solo that leads into the final chorus.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe old saying stays true on the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢16 MinutesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Save the best Ã¢â‚¬â„¢til last.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬ËœRule The WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ takes obvious influence from the likes of Pantera and we couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be happier with the result. Ã¢â‚¬ËœSTDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has an incredibly bouncy riff that leads in to a throaty, gruffy verse sung by Caffrey. This soon transitions into a chorus where he once again shows his flexibility as a vocalist, emulating the likes of Eddie Vedder with extremely catchy melodies. Ã¢â‚¬ËœSteal Your CrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ opens with a stellar, yet now unfamiliar, acoustic performance from Murray and Clifford. This leads into what seems like a fairly generic metal tune for the first 3 minutes but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry, the song is saved with an aggressive, punchy finale that contains the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest guitar solo and some absolutely incredible drum fills.\n\nThe true standout from the album lies in the final track. Ã¢â‚¬ËœSicknessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ could be considered a completely different genre of music when compared to the rest of the CD, in the best way. The songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s verses are reminiscent of something found on an Alice in Chains album, while the chorus holds a grungey, infectious melody that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have stuck in your head for the rest of the week upon hearing it even once. The song runs at over 5 minutes long, but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be itching to hear it again instantly.\n\nBlack Svan have truly impressed us with their first studio album. The talent in this band is simply undeniable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from Keith CaffreyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant vocal range to Jagger MurrayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantastic guitar solos to Joey AfonsoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mesmerizing accuracy and speed behind the kit. Unfortunately, there isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an awful lot of variety to be found. Each song has the same underlying vibe to them, though hopefully this is something the group will mend in future releases. The accessible album length of just 10 tracks gives us a great insight to what the band can offer though Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to hear what else they have up their sleeves.\n\n\n\nDiscography:\n16 Minutes 2014\n\n\nLineup:\nKeith Caffrey: Vocals\nJagger Murray: Lead Guitar\nMo Clifford: Rhythm Guitar\nKenneth Bell: Bass\nJoey Afonso: Drums\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Black Svan\nAlbum: 16 Minutes\nGenre: Hard Rock\nSubGenre: Progressive Metal, Alternative\nYear: 2014\nCountry Of Origin: Ireland\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: 320 kbps\nSize: 107.74 MB\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\n\nTracklist\n01.
