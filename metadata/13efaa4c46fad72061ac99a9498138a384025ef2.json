I bought the only copy left (the artist destroyed the last backup by smashing the hard drive containing the backup, that's part of the artistic process). I thought I should upload it, now that I'm the only owner of the movie.\n\nThe artist described the piece as follows:\n\nNight supermarket is ambulation on the shopping center car parks at night, punctuated by the music of Jean-Michel Jarre: &quot;Music for supermarkets&quot;.\nThis album introduced a state of trance, trance applied in driving a car on desert car parks: at night, the freshness, the music, the desert environment, the park becomes a constraint, an event. This thirty minutes video will be sold at a public auction in a single copy: so that this moment remains unique.\nPiracy of this work will be encouraged just like the disk of Jean-Michel Jarre was in his time. The master will be destroyed, the vido will disappear from the display. This will be a story to transmit through Peer to Peer.\n\nmore: www.jacqueslopez.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13efaa4c46fad72061ac99a9498138a384025ef2","amp;dn":"night+supermarket.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13efaa4c46fad72061ac99a9498138a384025ef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,239,170,76,70,250,215,32,97,172,153,169,73,129,56,163,132,2,94,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
