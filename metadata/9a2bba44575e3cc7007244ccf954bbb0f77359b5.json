This encompasses a series of train, car and river journeys all excellently shown with some very good cinematography. Lots of wide vistas of deserts - along the lines of Lawrence of Arabia and the English Patient, etc. - and lots of town scenes and interviews with musicians, traders, and others.\n\nThere's a lot of ethnic music in the programme too (particularly episode 2) which reminds me of Buena Vista Social Club, only this time it's Africa.\n\nThe 2 disc DVD is good though with very few additional features. It would've been nice to have some stuff on how they film the series - for instance, Michael Palin is often shown departing on a train yet where do the film crew go? Do they follow in a car or what?&amp;quot;\n\n\nEventuellt kan jag ÃƒÂ¤ven lÃƒÂ¤gga upp de andra Palin serierna senare:\nPole To Pole with Michael Palin.\nHimalaya with Michael Palin.\nFull Circle with Michael Palin.\nAround the World in 80 days with Michael Palin.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a2bba44575e3cc7007244ccf954bbb0f77359b5","amp;dn":"Sahara+with+Michael+Palin+-+2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a2bba44575e3cc7007244ccf954bbb0f77359b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,43,186,68,87,94,60,199,0,114,68,204,249,84,187,176,247,115,89,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
