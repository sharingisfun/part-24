Two screaming, weeping and weaving electric guitars lead the way as three part vocal harmonies Ã¯Â¬â€šoat like feathers over the ocean of sound below. Behind them a thumping, thunderous rhythm section brings the beast to life, while the drone of an electric organ creates an aura of mystery and tension.\n\nApril 2014 saw the online release of their long-awaited debut full length album &quot;You're The Everything In Us&quot;.\n\n&quot;A shadowy form has taken shape out of Cape Town, South Africa, and it's called The Very Wicked. Brooding psychedelia with gorgeous vocals (Black Mountain-esque at times), methodical rhythms, and droning guitars. This is an impressive debut that is sure to have you road-tripping down the highway of your mind.&quot; - Ongakubaka","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:833e64c26508d2e8aef1ff42ec50e8975bf3cce8","amp;dn":"The+Very+Wicked+-+You%27re+the+Everything+in+Us+%282014%29+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"833e64c26508d2e8aef1ff42ec50e8975bf3cce8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,62,100,194,101,8,210,232,174,241,255,66,236,80,232,151,91,243,204,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
