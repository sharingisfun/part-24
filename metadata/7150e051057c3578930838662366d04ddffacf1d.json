Eduardo SÃƒÂ¡ez, James C. Baygents (CRC, 2015).pdf\n\nISBN 978-1-4665-7624-7\n\nEnvironmental Transport Phenomena offers a detailed yet accessible introduction to transport phenomena. It begins by explaining the underlying principles and mechanisms that govern mass transport and continues by tackling practical problems spanning all subdisciplines of environmental science and chemical engineering. \nAssuming some knowledge of ordinary differential equations and a familiarity with basic applications of fluid mechanics, this classroom-tested text:\n\n\n\nAddresses mass conservation and macroscopic mass balances, placing a special emphasis on applications to environmental processes\n\nCovers the fundamentals of diffusive transport, applications of the diffusion equation, and diffusive transport in reactive systems\n\nDiscusses convective transport, hydrodynamic dispersion, and transport in multiphase systems\n\nPresents a mathematical framework for formulating and solving transport phenomena problems\n\nEnvironmental Transport Phenomena makes an ideal textbook for a one-semester advanced undergraduate or graduate introductory course in transport phenomena. It provides a fundamental understanding of how to quantify the spread and distribution of contaminants in the environment as well as the basis for designing processes related to water purification, wastewater treatment, and solid waste disposal, among others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7150e051057c3578930838662366d04ddffacf1d","amp;dn":"Environmental+Transport+Phenomena","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7150e051057c3578930838662366d04ddffacf1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,80,224,81,5,124,53,120,147,8,56,102,35,102,208,77,223,250,207,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
