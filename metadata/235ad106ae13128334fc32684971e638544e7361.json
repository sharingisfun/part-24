He'd been flying in the Royal Air Force and now he was returning, wounded and disillusioned, to his ancestral home seeking rest and peace. But somewhere in the comfortable atmosphere of the Duncan mansion a dissonant cord had sounded. Days before his return Jessie Proctor had taken her own life. Why? Allan looked at the young face in the photograph in Jessie's passport. And froze. He knew who Jessie really was.\n\n&quot;Mr. Shute makes the reader feel all the mystery and the magic of young people meeting under danger and strangeness. The story has suspense and the kind of dramatic effect Shute excels in,&quot; Hartford Times. \n\n\n\nThe audio quality is not fantastic as these were old library tapes, but this is worth listening to.\n\n9 hours from 6 cassettes in MP3 format\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:235ad106ae13128334fc32684971e638544e7361","amp;dn":"Nevil+Shute+-+The+Breaking+Wave","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"235ad106ae13128334fc32684971e638544e7361","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,90,209,6,174,19,18,131,52,252,50,104,73,113,230,56,84,78,115,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
