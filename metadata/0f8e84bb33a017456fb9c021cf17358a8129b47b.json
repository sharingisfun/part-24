Unlike other texts, it begins with a detailed picture of the atom then builds toward chemistry\\'s frontier, continually demonstrating how to solve problems, think about nature and matter, and visualize chemical concepts in the same ways as working chemists. The new edition incorporates features that extend the book\\'s emphasis on modern techniques and applications while strengthening its problem solving approach.\n\nPlease help me seeding. Thanks.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f8e84bb33a017456fb9c021cf17358a8129b47b","amp;dn":"Chemical+Principles+-+The+quest+for+insight+%284th+edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f8e84bb33a017456fb9c021cf17358a8129b47b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,142,132,187,51,160,23,69,111,185,192,33,207,23,53,138,129,41,180,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
