I can't vouch for it's authenticity, except to say that I've done a spectral analysis of it in Adobe Audition myself, and it seems like the real deal. I've listened to it on a decent stereo, and in decent headphones, and some of the compression artifacts I noticed on the official mp3 release are gone, so I ditched my mp3s in favor of this.\n\nOf course, that'd be the opinion of an anonymous stranger, but hey, there are few guarantees in life, right?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29ea036a02642466bfc24eeee82c486cbff6a79c","amp;dn":"Call+of+Duty+Black+Ops+II+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29ea036a02642466bfc24eeee82c486cbff6a79c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,234,3,106,2,100,36,102,191,194,78,238,232,44,72,108,191,246,167,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
