In All In, military expert Paula Broadwell examines Petraeus's career, his intellectual development as a military officer, and his impact on the U.S. military.\nAfforded extensive access by General Petraeus, his mentors, his subordinates, and his longtime friends, Broadwell embedded with the general, his headquarters staff, and his soldiers on the front lines of fighting and at the strategic command in Afghanistan to chronicle the experiences of this American general as they were brought to bear in the terrible crucible of war. All In draws on hundreds of hours of exclusive interviews with Petraeus and his top officers and soldiers to tell the inside story of this commander's development and leadership in war from every vantage point.\n\nWhen Petraeus assumed command in Afghanistan in July 2010, the conflict looked as bleak as at any moment in America's nine years on the ground there. Petraeus's defining idea-counterinsurgency-was immediate put to its most difficult test: the hard lessons learned during the surge in Iraq were to be applied in a radically different theater. All In examines the impact in Afghanistan of new counterinsurgency as well as counterterrorism strategies through the commands of several Petraeus protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©s.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;General Petraeus is one of the most important Americans of our time, in or out of uniform. This riveting, insider's account of his life and education is at once instructive and inspiring.&quot;\n-Tom Brokaw, Anchor and Managing Editor, NBC Nightly News; author of The Greatest Generation\n\n\n&quot;This majestic biography will set the standard for all future works about General Petraeus. With superb narrative skill, Broadwell simultaneously provides an intimate look at Petraeus the man, a fascinating account of modern warfare, and an elegant study of leadership.&quot;\n(-Doris Kearns Goodwin, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of No Ordinary Time )\n\n&quot;Teddy Roosevelt once said that it is not enough to be intelligent; a leader must also be honest and fearless. In General David Petraeus (himself a T.R. fan), America has been fortunate to have a soldier-scholar who is all three. Paula Broadwell, soldier-scholar in her own right, tells the Petraeus story masterfully, providing especially rich detail and insight into his Afghanistan mission. This book helps us understand how Petraeus has become the living legend he is.&quot;\n(-David Gergen, author of Eyewitness to Power )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447ae447ac480912506c903699d8c2c289180921","amp;dn":"All+In++-+The+Education+of+General+David+Petraeus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447ae447ac480912506c903699d8c2c289180921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,122,228,71,172,72,9,18,80,108,144,54,153,216,194,194,137,24,9,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
