Fuck yeh! I was one, and i had long hair then too!\n\nMonsters Of Rock began in 1980 and ran through 1988 when two fans died during the GNR set. Initially the blame was thought to be the size of the crowd circa 107,000 and a rush forward during the bands set, but officially the cause is laid on the weather, causing muddy and wet conditions on the sloping ground.  As a result the festival was cancelled the following year, returning in 1990 with a limitation to the crowd of 75,000.  The event had many European spin offÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the same name and was a great success in its day.  Denim and leather lives on!\n\n\n\n\n1985 line up:\n\nZZ Top\nMarillion\nBon Jovi\nMetallica\nRatt\nMagnum\nRadio 1 Tommy Vance (DJ)\n\n\n\n\n\nMettalicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set was remembered for its raw uncompromising sound as well as the infamous quote...Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you came here to see spandex and fuckinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ eye make-up and all that shit and the words Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Roll BabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in every fuckinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ song...this AINÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T THE FUCKINÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ BAND!

Perhaps somebody, somewhere can clear all this up for me. What I do remember is not liking Ratt too much but enjoying Metallica who eventually became one of my favourite bands. Sadly, history would dictate that this was the only time I ever saw them with Cliff Burton.\n\nIt was a great day Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I remember Cliff BurtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bass sounding (fantastically) like nothing on earth, the hail of plastic bottles between Marillion and ZZ Top; Eliminator (ZZ TopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s car) slung beneath a helicopter circling the festival; a triumphant set by Magnum; Bon Jovi being brilliant; Marillion riding their crest and it being a hot, sunny day. Fantastic!\n\nMetallica - seem to remember that there was a bit of a buzz about this lot as being the next big thing. I was keen to buy a tshirt, but all that was on offer was a &quot;metal up your ass&quot; one with a picture of a knife wielding hand coming out of a toilet - which is a bloody awful image. The sound was big and different, but I thought that it wasn't really my kind of thing - still isn't. I understand that they've managed to forge a reasonably successful career despite my lack of support","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70f2804f4b6425023dbfc403ef992f755d69adc9","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+Bootleg+%28Monsters+Of+Rock%2C+Castle+Donington+17th+Aug","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70f2804f4b6425023dbfc403ef992f755d69adc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,242,128,79,75,100,37,2,61,191,196,3,239,153,47,117,93,105,173,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
