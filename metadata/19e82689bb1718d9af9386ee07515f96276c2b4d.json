Born in Los Angeles in 1938, Jones was the son of the romantic lead actor and recording artist Allan Jones (who had a hit with &quot;The Donkey Serenade&quot;) and actress Irene Hervey. He began studying the vocal arts in high school, and after graduation joined his father's successful act on the nightclub circuit. Jack left less than a year later, determined to make it on his own, and began playing small clubs around the country.\n\nSeveral years after forging his independence, Jack Jones was spotted in San Francisco and signed to Kapp Records in 1961. Though he was called into the army soon after, he managed to record the single &quot;Lollipops and Roses,&quot; a moderate 1962 hit which earned him a Grammy for Best Performance by a Male Singer. Jones earned several other awards during the mid-'60s, including another Grammy for his best-known hit, the Burt Bacharach-Hal David chestnut &quot;Wives and Lovers.&quot; Though he only recorded one more single that performed as well, 1965's &quot;The Race Is On,&quot; Jones became a successful LP seller, touring artist (especially in Great Britain), and occasional television performer. He moved to RCA Records in 1967, and began to add to his repertoire rock songs such as &quot;Light My Fire&quot; and &quot;I Think It's Gonna Rain Today.&quot; Jack Jones also mounted a successful act in Las Vegas during the 1980s and '90s.\n\n\nAlbums:\n\n1959 - This Love of Mine\n1959 - To Whom It May Concern\n1961 - Lollipops and Roses\n1961 - Shall We Dance\n1961 - This Was My Love\n1962 - Gift of Love\n1962 - I've Got a Lot of Livin' To Do\n1962 - Special Olders\n1963 - Call Me Irresponsible\n1963 - She Loves Me\n1963 - Wives and Lovers\n1964 - Bewitched\n1964 - In Love\n1964 - The Jack Jones Christmas Album\n1964 - Where Love Has Gone\n1965 - Dear Heart\n1965 - My Kind Of Town\n1965 - There's Love And There's Love And Thre's Love\n1966 - A Very Precious Love\n1966 - For The ''In'' Crowd\n1966 - Jack Jones Sings\n1966 - On Broadway\n1966 - The Impossible Dream\n1967 - Feeling Good\n1967 - Lady\n1967 - Our Song\n1968 - Curtain Time\n1968 - Greatest Hits\n1968 - If You Ever Leave Me\n1968 - In Hollywood\n1968 - What The World Needs Now Is Love\n1968 - Without Her\n1969 - A Jack Jones Christmas\n1969 - L.A.
