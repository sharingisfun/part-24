A how-to guide, tried and tested by countless groups across the world. An important document for anyone vaguely inquisitive, or seriously interested. Written by the Brazilian as a reaction to the failure of Guevara and the rural guerillas. This new edition includes two other documents by Marighella - Problems And Principles Of Strategy And Questions Of Organization, a 1970 interview with liberated Brazilian political prisoners, and a chronology of the guerilla struggle in Brazil from 1964-73. &quot;It is better to err acting than to do nothing for fear of erring. Without initiative there is no guerilla warfare.&quot;\n\nPlease seed and enjoy\n\nif you like this book then please buy a copy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01d28c9d5b3ee83dc317e8940bce1eb43f3a1f52","amp;dn":"mini+manual+of+the+urban+guerrilla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01d28c9d5b3ee83dc317e8940bce1eb43f3a1f52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,210,140,157,91,62,232,61,195,23,232,148,11,206,30,180,63,58,31,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
