Since the Middle Ages artists have been creating images that have become part of the popular imagination. An 'ideal' view of nature was first depicted in the 16th century. Later, artists saw landscape in terms of architecture or of light. While 19th-century painters were 'true' to nature, recent artists have interpreted it symbolically.\r\nThe authoritative text takes into account new research in art history. Over 100 full-color illustrations are complemented by tinted information panels providing specific reference to each major painting, its background and critical interpretations.\r\nArtists in this book include Altdorfer, Van Eyck, Bellini, Giorgione, Bruegel, Poussin, Claude, Watteau, Turner, Constable, Courbet, Van Gogh, and Magritte","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4935ac7f38ef5fbfad83c1ec4ef650bc17580319","amp;dn":"Landscape+Painting+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4935ac7f38ef5fbfad83c1ec4ef650bc17580319","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,53,172,127,56,239,95,191,173,131,193,236,78,246,80,188,23,88,3,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
