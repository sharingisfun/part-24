For additional assistance, it includes a glossary of biological terms, many figures illustrating theoretical concepts, numerous solved sample problems, and mathematical appendices. The text is geared toward seniors and first-year graduate students in engineering and physics as well as professionals in medicine and medical implant/device industries. It can be used as a primary selection for a comprehensive course or for a two-course sequence.\r\n\r\nThe book has two main parts: theory, comprising the first two chapters; and applications, constituting the remainder of the book. Specifically, the author reviews the fundamentals of physical and related biological transport phenomena, such as mass, momentum, and heat transfer in biomedical systems, and highlights complementary topics such as two-phase flow, biomechanics, and fluid-structure interaction. Two appendices summarize needed elements of engineering mathematics and CFD software applications, and these are also found in the fifth chapter. The application part, in form of project analyses, focuses on the cardiovascular system with common arterial diseases, organ systems, targeted drug delivery, and stent-graft implants.\r\n\r\nArmed with Biofluid Dynamics, students will be ready to solve basic biofluids-related problems, gain new physical insight, and analyze biofluid dynamics aspects of biomedical systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e02fa0d5a7f8b617da4f8ad24b491a9a39c250f7","amp;dn":"Biofluid+Dynamics+-+Principles+and+Selected+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e02fa0d5a7f8b617da4f8ad24b491a9a39c250f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,47,160,213,167,248,182,23,218,79,138,210,75,73,26,154,57,194,80,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
