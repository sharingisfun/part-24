And also your Internet provider can exactly see which Web sites you visit and what kind of data you upload or download. \nWhen you use a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) or a hot spot to access the Internet wirelessly, for example at a train station, an airport, or in an Internet cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, it won&amp;#039;t be a problem for anyone to spy on you. \n\nIt just takes the corresponding software to turn you into a transparent user. All your movements on the Web can then be exactly traced - whether you send private e-mails, carry out online purchases, or enter your personal access data. \nEven when you dial in to online applications, you are unprotected: Someone could &quot;stow away&quot; and use your access data unnoticed in order to manipulate and even delete important data! \n\nWhy surf anonymously? I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have anything to hide.As soon as you go online, you receive a clear Internet protocol address - an IP. The IP acts like a transmitter on the Internet to fix your location and can therefore be traced back to the very door of your house. Every provider of Web pages can recognize precisely what you have done on their Web site: Which products have you viewed but not bought? Which images have you looked at? And even your provider can view a large amount of data such as the movies and songs you have uploaded and downloaded on your legal file sharing platform. \n\nIt&amp;#039;s not about whether you have something to hide or not. You have a right to privacy and do not have to justify this. Allow yourself the freedom of surfing the Web anonymously as well as of uploading and downloading data. \n\nHow does Steganos Internet Anonym VPN work?A Virtual Private Network (VPN) establishes a tunnel between your computer and one of the Steganos VPN servers. All your activities on the Internet are then carried out through that tunnel. The tunnel encrypts all information that runs through it by using an SSL connection which protects the information from being eavesdropped - even by your ISP. SSL \nconnections are, for instance, also used for online banking activities. The tunnel leads to one of the Steganos servers which, in turn, forwards the request onto the Web. This way you can act completely anonymously on the Internet. The Web \nsites you visit will merely see the IP address of the Steganos servers.
