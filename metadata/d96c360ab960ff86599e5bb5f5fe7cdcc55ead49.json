Not playing off comparisons to the Cure and the Smiths, vocalist Katie Sketch and her band compose the usual rhymes of heartbreak, loneliness, and melancholy. In order to set themselves apart from the new-millennium posh crowd of New York City bands, the Organ craft such darkness into a lush, modern style that&amp;#039;s strict and almost succinct. The Sinking Hearts EP shines bright in the midst of despair, particularly on the dreamy soundscape of &quot;We&amp;#039;ve Got to Meet.&quot; Soft electronic beats are playfully woven around Jenny Smyth&amp;#039;s Hammond organ on the jaunty &quot;I Am Not Surprised,&quot; while warm bass rhythms slowly dance on &quot;It&amp;#039;s Time to Go.&quot; The Organ obviously look back at what once was, taking only the gorgeous bits of post-punk and making them their own. The Sinking Hearts EP is a glorious introduction, but such a glimpse into the Organ&amp;#039;s art-pop world simply isn&amp;#039;t enough. \n\nTRACKS: \n1. We&amp;#039;ve Got To Meet \n2.
