The kindle can automatically crop white space so I figured out a simple way to make PDFs look nice on the kindle, Its pretty obvious what I did when you open the (kdx) file.\n\nAll the other versions of book 12 were a mess, I spent a long time cleaning this up. There are still two words in itallics at the start of some chapter that I couldnt decipher.. but in general it is a very clean copy.\n\n\nI have also included rtf/doc format so you arent locked in to my PDF choices.\n\nMy seeding will be erratic so be patient.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:940ff9e4b05ca990b9792e54d21e010006da6731","amp;dn":"Wheel+of+Time+12+-+Cleaned+%28KindleDX+supported%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"940ff9e4b05ca990b9792e54d21e010006da6731","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,15,249,228,176,92,169,144,185,121,46,84,210,30,1,0,6,218,103,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
