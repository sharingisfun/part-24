Walking a tight-rope over recent times, Britney Spears is back to let her music speak for itself with an irresistibly up-tempo and catchy pop album.\n\n      Moving past the personal drama that lent itself lyrically to the majority of her last album release, the synth-laden Blackout, Britney Spears is back in confident form with a selection of pop rock confections. Opening with the staccato-beat filled hit single &amp;#039;Womanizer&amp;#039; Circus shows a bright and refreshing side to the newly reformed Britney Spears as she revisits and reworks some of her most celebrated styles and sounds. While &amp;#039;Piece Of Me&amp;#039; producers Bloodshy &amp; Avant bring to life the melodic &amp;#039;Unusual You&amp;#039;, Max Martin who wrote and produced her 1998 breakthrough hit &amp;#039;...Baby One More Time&amp;#039;, demonstrates his perfect pop arrangements on the saucy stomper &amp;#039;If You Seek Amy&amp;#039;. Touching on R&amp;B stylistics on the sleek &amp;#039;Lace And Leather&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Kill The Lights&amp;#039;, Britney Spears shows that she is capable of adapting her voice as she launches from the slow-rocking &amp;#039;Blur&amp;#039; into the funky &amp;#039;Mmm Papi&amp;#039;. The acoustic guitar led &amp;#039;Out For Under&amp;#039; is a tingling power ballad that resembles her 2001 hit &amp;#039;I&amp;#039;m Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&amp;#039; and sees Britney Spears hitting thunderous high notes with delicate precision. As the album draws to a close, &amp;#039;My Baby&amp;#039;, reminiscent of her debut album track &amp;#039;Born To Make You Happy&amp;#039;, is a colossal heart-wrenching ballad that marks a mature step for Britney Spears both lyrically and vocally.\n\n      Despite difficult bouts in her personal life, Britney Spears shows with Circus that she has grown as an artist. By working with a selection of producers that she has previously worked with and is introducing for the first time with this album, Britney Spears has been able to build on her own reputable techniques to add futuristic flourishes that will appeal to both her established fans and new-found Britney Spears listeners alike.\n\nTrack List\t\n\n \n\n   1.
