This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nNewcomer Pat Benetar debuts with her first chart hit, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (at number 40), and Pink Floyd debuts only the second chart hit in their 15 year career, &quot;Another Brick In The Wall Part Two&quot; (at number 32).\n\nA listener wants to know if any song has ever hit number one on the pop, soul, and country charts. Casey says it has happened only twice, and both times were in the 50's.\n\nCasey recalls how the greatest recording act in history was once so unsure of its own popularity that, in a rock band popularity poll, its members became involved in election fraud by writing in hundreds of fake votes for themselves.\n\nOne unknown but hopeful teenager once turned down contracts from four major record companies because they wouldn't agree to his terms. His first hit is in this countdown.\n\nA listener wants to know what the biggest selling live album in the rock era has been. Casey says this particular album was by a solo performer who was not a superstar when he released it.\n\nCasey gives a special report on the musical style &quot;Rockabilly&quot; and the latest Rockabilly song to make the chart. It's in the top 10.\n\nLW#3: Coward Of The County - Kenny Rogers\nLW#2: Do That To Me One More Time - The Captain &amp; Tennille\nLW#1: Rock With You - Michael Jackson\n40: Heartbreaker - Pat Benetar\n39: 99 - Toto\n38: Send One Your Love - Stevie Wonder\n37: Ladies' Night - Kool &amp; The Gang\n36: Him - Rupert Holmes\n35: How Do I Make You - Linda Ronstadt\n34: Lost Her In The Sun - John Stewart\n33: The Second Time Around - Shalamar\n32: Another Brick In The Wall Part Two - Pink Floyd\nARCHIVES: Summer Nights - Glen Campbell\n31: Refugee - Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers\n30: Do You Love What You Feel - Rufus &amp; Chaka\n29: Wonderland - Commodores\nLDD: Rise - Herb Alpert\n28: When I Wanted You - Barry Manilow\n27: Too Hot - Kool &amp; The Gang\n26: Why Me - Styx\nEXTRA: I Want To Hold Your Hand - The Beatles\n25: Working My Way Back To You - The Spinners\n24: Third Time Lucky - Foghat\n23: We Don't Talk Anymore - Cliff Richard\nARCHIVES: Hotel California - The Eagles\n22: Fool In The Rain - Led Zeppelin\n21: September Morn' - Neil Diamond\n20: I Wanna Be Your Lover - Prince\n19: An American Dream - The Dirt Band\n18: Don't Let Go - Isaac Hayes\n17: Daydream Believer - Anne Murray\n16: Romeo's Theme - Steve Forbert\n15: DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu - Dionne Warwick\n14: On The Radio - Donna Summer\n13: Desire - Andy Gibb\n12: Escape - Rupert Holmes\nARCHIVES: When I Need You - Leo Sayer\n11: This Is It - Kenny Loggins\n10: Don't Do Me Like That - Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers\nLDD: Daniel - Elton John\n9: Longer - Dan Fogelberg\n8: The Long Run - The Eagles\n7: Sara - Fleetwood Mac\n6: Yes, I'm Ready - Teri De Sario With K.C.\n5: Crazy Little Thing Called Love - Queen\n4: Crusin' - Smokey Robinson\n3: Coward Of The County - Kenny Rogers\n2: Do That To Me One More Time - The Captain &amp; Tennille\n1: Rock With You - Michael Jackson\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9b915a4cd8ffaf269844d4a15cb8275dcb6c4c9","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1980_February_9th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9b915a4cd8ffaf269844d4a15cb8275dcb6c4c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,185,21,164,205,143,250,242,105,132,77,74,21,203,130,117,220,182,196,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
