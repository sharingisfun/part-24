Allow Me, his first recording for Rounder Records, finds Shear back in solo mode after 1998's collection of duets, Between Us. Like that record, Allow Me is a collection of love songs, but the mood here is comparatively optimistic. Shear's melodies are as catchy and his lyrics as sharp as ever, especially on &quot;Nothing Is New&quot; and the opener, &quot;Hard Enough,&quot; one of Shear's patented wake-up calls to a troubled friend; he's also in fine, relaxed vocal form. But Allow Me is not Shear's strongest overall effort: &quot;Deep&quot; and &quot;Love With You&quot; are unexceptional bar-band rockers, and the latter features flashy backing vocals that are singularly at odds with his down-to-earth persona. The album is also less cohesive than some of his other works, and some songs are obscured by clunky arrangements. Still, even lesser Jules Shear is a gift to fans of intelligent pop. .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66388d63fea15485f344c068e8aebaaf11fb8827","amp;dn":"Jules+Shear+-+Allow+Me+%5B2000%5D%5BEAC%2CLOG%2CCUE%2CFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66388d63fea15485f344c068e8aebaaf11fb8827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,56,141,99,254,161,84,133,243,68,192,104,232,174,186,175,17,251,136,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
