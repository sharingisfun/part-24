Innovations such as autoclaved aerated concrete masonry (AAC) are also discussed. Real-world case studies featuring a low-rise building with reinforced concrete masonry and a four-story building with clay masonry illustrate the techniques presented in this comprehensive resource.\n\nCoverage includes:\n\n    * Basic structural behavior and design of low-rise, bearing wall buildings\n    * Materials used in masonry construction\n    * Code basis for structural design of masonry buildings, including seismic design\n    * Introduction of MSJC treatment of structural design\n    * Strength design of reinforced and unreinforced masonry elements\n    * Allowable-stress design of reinforced and unreinforced masonry elements\n    * Comparison of design by the allowable-stress approach versus the strength approach\n    * Lateral load analysis of shear wall structure\n    * Design and detailing of floor and roof diaphragms\n\nAbout the Author\nRichard E. Klingner, Ph.D., is a professor in the Department of Structural Engineering, University of Texas at Austin.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 588 pages\n    * Publisher: McGraw-Hill Professional; 1 edition (March 5, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 007163830X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0071638302","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e49de4cc851210d1057d57668a2fd0d6f45b56a","amp;dn":"Masonry+Structural+Design%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e49de4cc851210d1057d57668a2fd0d6f45b56a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,73,222,76,200,81,33,13,16,87,213,118,104,162,253,13,111,69,181,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
