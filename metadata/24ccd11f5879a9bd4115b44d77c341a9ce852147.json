We follow the fates of various people during trying times in the shadow of a war - which would later be called The Thirty Years' War. At the time, Stockholm was a small and dangerous capital, with barely fitteen thousand inhabitants. The Stockholm shipyard, run by Margareta Hybertsson, was the largest workplace in the city. It took more than three years to complete this comprehensive dramatization.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e7/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b6/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a2/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/67/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/22/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/80/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bf/Vasa-1628-The-People-the-Ship-the-Era-SVT-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: ~4415 Kbps (CRF 21)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Audio Track: Swedish - AAC Stereo ~150Kbps 48KHz\r\n * Run-Time: 1h 49mn (Total)\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: ~1.70 GiB (average)\r\n * Container: MKV\r\n * Released: 2011\r\n * Source: HDTV AVC 720p (Thanks to ToK)\r\n * Encoder: KarMa\r\n * Merged Subtitles: English (default/forced)\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.svt.se/dokumentarfilm/vasa-1628 \nhttp://www.svt.se/dokumentarfilm/vasa-1628-del-2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24ccd11f5879a9bd4115b44d77c341a9ce852147","amp;dn":"SVT+Vasa+1628+The+People+The+Ship+The+Era+2of2+720p+x264+AAC+HDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24ccd11f5879a9bd4115b44d77c341a9ce852147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,204,209,31,88,121,169,189,65,21,180,77,119,195,65,169,206,133,33,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
