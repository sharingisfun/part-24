Tourists normally pay upto $3000 for the right to visit the &quot;Hermit Kingdom&quot; and this film gives you the opportunity to see inside the reclusive country. Unfortunately Matt's anti North Korean bias is obvious, and the exaggerated storyline and post-production gives it a somewhat pornographic feel, like an episode of &quot;A Current Affair&quot;. Nevertheless, this is one of the better films that have been made by tourists to the DPRK in recent years and makes for entertaining viewing.\n\nRating: 3 stars\n\n\n\nUpdate: Get this film before they ban it!\n\nThere has been speculation that this film is part of a recent wave of anti North Korean propaganda, designed to sway opinion before further US sanctions. Even hack group Anonymous seems to be involved: http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/anonymous-hackers-take-control-of-north-korean-propaganda-sites/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ded7a4610acf855f28f2b8eb31f399f7268fb46f","amp;dn":"DPRK%3A+The+Land+Of+Whispers+%28North+Korea+Travel+Documentary%29+%28201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ded7a4610acf855f28f2b8eb31f399f7268fb46f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,215,164,97,10,207,133,95,40,242,184,235,49,243,153,247,38,143,180,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
