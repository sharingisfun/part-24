Wright believed in designing structures which were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was best exemplified by his design for Fallingwater (1935), which has been called &quot;the best all-time work of American architecture&quot;. Wright was a leader of the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.\n\nHis work includes original and innovative examples of many different building types, including offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums. Wright also designed many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and stained glass. Wright authored 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. His colorful personal life often made headlines, most notably for the 1914 fire and murders at his Taliesin studio. Already well known during his lifetime, Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as &quot;the greatest American architect of all time.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3ede54da6c943a0cb471b5d4d80858f08271068","amp;dn":"Frank+Lloyd+Wright+%28TV%29+%5B1998%5D+Ken+Burns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3ede54da6c943a0cb471b5d4d80858f08271068","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,237,229,77,166,201,67,160,203,71,27,93,77,128,133,143,8,39,16,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
