You need to disable and enable the network adapter back in order to apply the new settings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fe2a43557e222228e21af3094a645daffed3844","amp;dn":"Win7+MAC+Address+Changer+portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fe2a43557e222228e21af3094a645daffed3844","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,226,164,53,87,226,34,34,142,33,175,48,148,166,69,218,255,237,56,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
