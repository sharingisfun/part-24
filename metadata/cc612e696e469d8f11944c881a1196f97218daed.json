She describes how scientists came to understand the \nrole of omega-3s in our diet, why commercial processing has removed them from the food we eat, and what the tremendous consequences have been \nfor our health. \n\nIn many Western countries, epidemics of inflammatory diseases and metabolic disorders have been traced to omega-3 deficiencies. \nThe Queen of Fats provides information for every consumer who wants to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, arthritis, and obesity and \nto improve brain function and overall health.
