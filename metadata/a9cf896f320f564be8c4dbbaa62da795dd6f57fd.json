This new album might strike a\nbetter chord with long time fans who were\ndisappointed with the so-called more modern sound\nof the previous Hole in the Sun. Somewhere in\nCalifornia runs more towards that anthem-like\narena ready sound that made the Eighties famous.\n\nSomewhere in California opens strong with\nautobiographical Growin' Up in California, a\nmelodic rocker with a summer, top down\nconvertible, feel. That arena anthem character\nkicks in the following songs. Lay It On Me is\nheavier, but catchy, melodic rocker with strong\nguitar (but that's every here). Bye Bye Baby has\nsentimental feel wrapped up in a strong vocal\narrangement and the hook of a big chorus. Follow\nYour Heart offers a steady pace, a bit of blues,\nand another hard rock anthem. Another song ready\nfor the open air is semi-ballad Time of Our Lives,\nbeginning with simple piano and vocals and then\nsoaring to conclusion. No Time to Lose Ya is pure\nAOR melodic rock suitable for framing in the\nsummer sun or evening of radio airplay.\n\nThis opening momentum continues in the latter half\nof Somewhere in California, with a few curious\nturns. Live for Today is another fine and\nambitious ballad (with a bit Beatlesque feel?),\nbut seems a little drawn out. It's Not Over is\nanother solid rocker, yet trips over itself with\nrepetitiveness of the chorus. Rock N Roll Tonite\nis exactly what you would expect: an anthem to\nrock; its rowdy and gives the band a chance to get\nraucous. However, it's not quit as gripping as\nsome of the earlier tunes. Nevertheless, these are\nall fine songs showing Night Ranger significant\nskill in musicianship and song craftsmanship. To\nthis end, Somewhere in California closes with Say\nIt With Love, a rather inspirational, if not\nsentimental, piece that finds Night Ranger\nreturning to that accessible AOR arena rock sound.\n\nHonestly, on Somewhere in California Night Ranger\nsounds better than ever. This is solid,\nwell-crafted, melodic rock: accessible,\ninfectious, and entertaining. It's a perfect\nrelease for your Summer play list.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nightranger.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nightranger.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKLV is the foreign music division of KALEVALA\n\nwant us on your secure, non-rented, non-.de/.at/.ch\nsite full of nice ppl and no dickheads?\ntry to get a hold of us on irc...\n\ngreets fly out to everyone we met over the years and\nmany good grps like:\n\nBERC - GREiD - hUSHhUSH - mwnd - soup - SHELTER - FNT\nrH - GRW - DEF - BCC - DPS - AEROHOLiCS - SiNNERS\nSAiNTS - Razor1911 - gEm - ss - FiCO - WAGNER\nBLooDWeiSeR - UKi - FFNDVD - NGP - aAF\n\n.....:  - -- -------\\/--\\--_((_oX_))_--/--\\/------- -- -  :.....\n\n..:  ....:             aBHO  _ __\\/__ _   -T!             :....  :..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9cf896f320f564be8c4dbbaa62da795dd6f57fd","amp;dn":"Night+Ranger-Somewhere+In+California-2011-KLV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9cf896f320f564be8c4dbbaa62da795dd6f57fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,207,137,111,50,15,86,75,232,196,219,186,166,45,167,149,221,111,87,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
