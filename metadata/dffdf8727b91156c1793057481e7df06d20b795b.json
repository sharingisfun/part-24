After the war, he began to write while working as an engineer in countries as far afield as Argentina. Acquainted with Grief, GaddaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first novel, set in an imaginary South American country, appeared in 1938. His masterpiece, That Awful Mess on the Via Merulana, was serialized after the war, but only published as a book in 1957. Both novels, like much else that Gadda wrote, were left incomplete. Among GaddaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other notable works are essays, film and radio scripts, a travel book, and his journals from World War I.\n\nIn a large apartment house in central Rome, two crimes are committed within a matter of days: a burglary, in which a good deal of money and precious jewels are taken, and a murder, as a young woman whose husband is out of town is found with her throat cut. Called in to investigate, melancholy Detective Ciccio, a secret admirer of the murdered woman and a friend of her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, discovers that almost everyone in the apartment building is somehow involved in the case, and with each new development the mystery only deepens and broadens. GaddaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sublimely different detective story presents a scathing picture of fascist Italy while tracking the elusiveness of the truth, the impossibility of proof, and the infinite complexity of the workings of fate, showing how they come into conflict with the demands of justice and love.\n\nItalo Calvino, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Alberto Moravia all considered That Awful Mess on the Via Merulana to be the great modern Italian novel. Unquestionably, it is a work of universal significance and protean genius: a rich social novel, a comic opera, an act of political resistance, a blazing feat of baroque wordplay, and a haunting story of life and death.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following book in ePUB format:\n\n* That Awful Mess on the Via Merulana - Carlo Emilio Gadda, introduction by Italo Calvino, translated from the Italian by William Weaver (NYRB Classics)\n \n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/that-awful-mess-on-the-via-merulana/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/that-awful-mess-on-the-via-merulana/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Emilio_Gadda&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Emilio_Gadda&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dffdf8727b91156c1793057481e7df06d20b795b","amp;dn":"Carlo+Emilio+Gadda+-+That+Awful+Mess+on+The+Via+Merulana","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dffdf8727b91156c1793057481e7df06d20b795b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,253,248,114,123,145,21,108,23,147,5,116,129,231,223,6,210,11,121,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
