I really like Tabor with pianos, it somehow always makes her music seem darker than it already is. Some really scornful and intense songs, but there is a really nice standout song called &quot;The Cloud Factory&quot; about a girl who has a dreamer for a father and a very grounded, miserable mother.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79e116c94b19e41127a7b1d01b06806ad920b82d","amp;dn":"June+Tabor...At+the+Wood%5C%27s+Heart%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79e116c94b19e41127a7b1d01b06806ad920b82d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,225,22,201,75,25,228,17,39,167,177,208,27,6,128,106,217,32,184,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
