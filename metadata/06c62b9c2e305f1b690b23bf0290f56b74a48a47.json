Will Yuuji prove to be the element the girls around him needed to take hold of their lives once more, or will the weight of their pasts prove too steep a wall to overcome?\nAnd in the first place, just who is Kazami Yuuji? While the true nature of the &quot;job&quot; he is wont to alight to at the most haphazard of moments remains shrouded in secrecy, one thing is for certain - his encroachment upon the quiet orchard known as Mihama Academy will prove itself momentous in one way or another. And of course, one cannot discount the possibility that perhaps Yuuji himself carries the weightiest past of any of the students...\n\n\nby TLWiki: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=Grisaia_no_Kajitsu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=Grisaia_no_Kajitsu&lt;/a&gt;\nTranslation: koestl\nTechnical: Doddler\nEditing: DxS, herkz\nImages: Roxas, Vodka\nMoral Support (?): Moogy, Futsuu, Cracklings\n\n\n\nmore translated visual novels in English - visit fuwanovel.org                                                      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org&lt;/a&gt;                                                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org/novels/64&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org/novels/64&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nnote: installation required. follow the installation instructions. this is v1.0 patch.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06c62b9c2e305f1b690b23bf0290f56b74a48a47","amp;dn":"%5BFuwanovel%5D+Grisaia+no+Kajitsu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06c62b9c2e305f1b690b23bf0290f56b74a48a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,198,43,156,46,48,95,27,105,11,35,191,2,144,245,107,116,164,138,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
