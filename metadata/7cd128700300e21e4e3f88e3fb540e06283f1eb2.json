For a Frenchman to criticize that trial and especially the French role in it in 1948 took great courage: the book was banned in France, copies of it were seized, and BardÃƒÂ¨che in 1952 was sentenced to a year in prison, although he spent only a few weeks there before being pardoned. His criticisms of the Nuremberg Trial have since been repeated by many others. Yet BardÃƒÂ¨cheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first book about Nuremberg remains something special, for it is much more than just a critique of the trial. It is the first work of Revisionism, and perhaps the only revisionist work that reads like great literature. It is a revisionist call-to-arms: it pleads for Ã¢â‚¬Å“history,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but recognizes that it is still too early for the history of the war to be written: emotions are running too high. It cries out for objectivity, but does so while simmering with passion. It does not merely refute lies; it spits venom at the liars","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cd128700300e21e4e3f88e3fb540e06283f1eb2","amp;dn":"Nuremberg+or+the+Promised+Land","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cd128700300e21e4e3f88e3fb540e06283f1eb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,209,40,112,3,0,226,30,78,63,136,227,251,84,14,6,40,63,30,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
