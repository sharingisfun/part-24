Frequently, the issue isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Ã¢â‚¬Å“how to,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually Ã¢â‚¬Å“what do they want me to do?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Learning the language of math in context is the first step in the right direction for helping yourself in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s math morass so parents can help their child find his or her way out of any math quagmire.\nUsing a similar methodology applied in SAT Score-Raising Math Dictionary, Kaplan now focuses on the parent in this no-nonsense guide to the lexicon of math. Math terminology and key concepts are defined and decoded into regular, everyday language to promote authentic understanding of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at the heart of any math problem.\nParents (and then students) learn how to kick word problems to the curb once they figure out how to simplify the language of math with Math for Moms and Dads' easy-to-follow lexicon and resource guide!\n\nAbout the Author\nKaplan Publishing is one of the nation's leading publishers of academic and professional development resources.
