Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n(There's another pdf version of this book around, but it's not very attractive, and I think I saw a place where it's missing some text. The version is this torrent is new and, in my opinion, better.)\n\n\ndescription:\n\nPorter's reputation as one of America's most distinguished writers rests chiefly on her superb short stories. This volume includes the collections Flowering Judas; Pale Horse, Pale Rider; and The Leaning Tower, as well as four stories not available elsewhere in book form.\n\nWinner of the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54ba1968ff93a0a59d830cf9165072dd99241141","amp;dn":"The+Collected+Stories+of+Katherine+Anne+Porter+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54ba1968ff93a0a59d830cf9165072dd99241141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,186,25,104,255,147,160,165,157,131,12,249,22,80,114,221,153,36,17,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
