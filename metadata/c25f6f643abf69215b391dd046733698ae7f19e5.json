Whether theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re swooping effortlessly over the gothic cello drone of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œForget Me NotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the string-soaked adaptation of the Emily Dickinson poem, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo. 32,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or providing an eerie sense of melancholy on the achingly tender ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLullaby for the BeleagueredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the a cappella, sea shanty-styled closer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPear Tree,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ HamptonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mixture of whimsy, eeriness, and intensity somehow manages to bring something new to a sound steeped in tradition. Indeed, its nine tracks couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be more old-school if they tried: check the fluttering flutes, enchanting steam pipes, and drum roll rhythms of opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Man Behind the Rhododendron,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which evoke the Victorian era which the empirical lyric themes are based on; the gentle brass section of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHoax and BenisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which lends a wartime jazz feel to the yearning torch song, and the Middle Eastern-tinged acoustic balladry of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKiss VÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sounding like something that would be played during a medieval coronation. Indeed, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a testament to HamptonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songwriting skills that the originals feel just as timeless as the two covers on offer here, a haunting birdsong-sampling rendition of mid-17th century folk tune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBenjamin Bowamaneer,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a lilting, banjo-plucking interpretation of Blind Mamie ForehandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gospel-blues classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHoney in the Rock.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Of course, with its focus on the historical Folly is unlikely to be embraced by the current nu-folk mainstream, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a spine-tingling listen which should enchant the majority of those who happen to stumble across it.\n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/07/13/mary-hampton/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/07/13/mary-hampton/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c25f6f643abf69215b391dd046733698ae7f19e5","amp;dn":"Mary+Hampton...Folly%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c25f6f643abf69215b391dd046733698ae7f19e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,95,111,100,58,191,105,33,91,57,29,208,70,115,54,152,174,127,25,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
