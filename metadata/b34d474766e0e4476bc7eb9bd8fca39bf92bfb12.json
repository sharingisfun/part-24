All have icons and backgrounds, most \nalso have audio for the XMB as well. Some are custom HQ art as the ones that \ncame with the PSP game looked horrible on the PS3 so I used hi-res art work to \nmake new icons and backgrounds. I think you will be happy with them all as I \nthink they look marvelous. \n\nAll retain their orignal Content ID given by Sony so \nno conflicts will happen during install and all can be installed at one time no \nproblems there. Saves work on all games and test using Rebug 4.30.2 CFW but will \nwork on any CFW. \n\nI have been told however 3.41 &amp; 3.55 saves will not work but \nany 4.XX CFW they will save just fine. I made this pack as I had so many I \nneeded to catch up and by the time this is seeded hopefull the next pack will be \nready. So stick with it and you will get some great games to play on your PS3. \n\nAstonishia Story \nBlade Dancer  Lineage of Light \nBlitz Overtime \nBrave Story  New Traveler \nClass of Heroes \nCrash Mind Over Mutant \nDisgaea 2  Dark Hero Days \nDisgaea Afternoon of Darkness \nDissidia  Final Fantasy \nDragoneers Aria \nFinal Fantasy I \nFinal Fantasy II \nFinal Fantasy III \nFinal Fantasy Tactics The War of The Lions \nJeanne d'Arc \nKnights in Nightmare \nMega Man Maverick Hunter X \nPoPoloCrois \nStar Ocean First Departure \nStar Ocean Second Evolution \nStrikers 1945 Plus \nTales of Eternity \nTales of the World \nTenchu Shadow Assassins \nYs The Ark of Napishtim\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nStill bringing you the best, ps3 content.
