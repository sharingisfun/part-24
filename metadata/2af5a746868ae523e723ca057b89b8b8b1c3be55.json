Jubei - State Of The Art [Dub Version - digital exclusive]\n\nJubei will drop his debut LP, To Have And Have Not in October.\n\nPaul Ager has been a stalwart in the Metalheadz late-period catalogue, and he's also released for labels like Ingredients, Critical's Modulations, and others. Jubei's tough and precise brand of drum &amp; bass has found favour with a number of bass music's most prominent DJsÃ¢â‚¬â€his tracks have appeared on mix CDs from Kasra, Goldie and J:Kenzo in the past two years alone.\n\nTo Have And Have Not looks to be Ager's most expansive release yet. It sees him dip down to dubstep tempo (and even lower) for a few tracks, and also features collaborations with the likes of dBridge, Youngsta, Consequence, Marcus Intalex, Goldie &amp; J:Kenzo, while DRS, SP:MC and Flowdan make vocal contributions. The album will see release on CD and digital with a bonus track, while the vinyl release comes in partsÃ¢â‚¬â€a 12-inch sampler, a 3LP package, and a bonus signed ten-inch record to round off the tracklist.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2af5a746868ae523e723ca057b89b8b8b1c3be55","amp;dn":"Jubei+-+To+Have+And+Have+Not+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2af5a746868ae523e723ca057b89b8b8b1c3be55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,245,167,70,134,138,229,35,231,35,202,5,123,137,184,184,177,195,190,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
