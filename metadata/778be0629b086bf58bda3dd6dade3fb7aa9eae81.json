Between July 1941 and April 1942 showed 41 Finnish Defence Forces newsreels are available for the first time after the war in its original form.\n\nExtras include the pre-war Suomi-Filmi newsreels and almost all short films during first year of Continuation War. Professor Ohto Manninen explains the background for rare film of the Finnish SS-men.\nThe attack phase was to presented as &quot;reportage&quot;. Tone of the newsreels was overtly propagandist and narration did not avoid bellicose humor or patriotic pathos.\nThe newsreels describe the advance to the East: during 1941 were captured Sortavala, Vyborg, Aunus, Salla, ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nislinna, Hanko, Kontupohja, Koivisto, KarhumÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ki ja Poventsa. Brotherhood in arms was presented in a number of newsreels.\nAs the fronts quieted, documentary style replaced the news-like style. The military arms of service were of equal treatment. Also conditions and the people of captured areas were filmed. On the home front camera picked up the soldierboys, air-surveillance-lottas and air-raid shelter personnel.\nBehind the pictures of newsreels were Combat Camera shooters from Information-Companies, State Institute of Information and Defence Forces Headquarters. Makers were mostly known film industry veterans.\n\nAudio: Finnish\nSubtitles: Swedish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:778be0629b086bf58bda3dd6dade3fb7aa9eae81","amp;dn":"+Jatkosodan+Katsaukset+I+%2F+Continuation+War+newsreels+I+%281941-42","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"778be0629b086bf58bda3dd6dade3fb7aa9eae81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,139,224,98,155,8,107,245,139,218,61,214,218,222,63,183,170,158,174,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
