He caught a lot of attention in the 'old school' Goa-trance scene in the last 2 years with an album on DAT records containing older unreleased tracks, a free online EP on UAF Records and several tracks on Suntrip compilations.\n\nToday Suntrip Records is proud to present his first up to date album filled with 8 fractal stormers!\n\n'The Inner Shift' starts with a slower deep story-telling track continued by several dance floor devastators. Tracks like Solarnium, Modulated Self Reminders, Magnetic Fields of Life, Elastic Harmonies and No Way Wrong Rmx are a treat for the brain! Earcandy for everyone who loves multi-layered melodic music. Expect melodies, spiced up with acidic sounds and hypnotic background atmospheres. Besides that, every track is a great story teller. When you listen carefully, we promise you a hell of a trip to colourful lands!\n\nThe last two tracks, Plutonia and Optronic Circles Rmx, are downtempo tracks to give you a peaceful landing back into reality!\n\nAre you ready for it!?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56395b1eba9816bc56bd471363c9a05fff9f1fd9","amp;dn":"Crossing+Mind+-+The+Inner+Shift+-+2012+%5Bgoa+trance%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56395b1eba9816bc56bd471363c9a05fff9f1fd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,57,91,30,186,152,22,188,86,189,71,19,99,201,160,95,255,159,31,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
