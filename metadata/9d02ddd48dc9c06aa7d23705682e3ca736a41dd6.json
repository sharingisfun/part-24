Hroub's aim is to &quot;debunk&quot; western misconceptions by depicting what he calls &quot;the real Hamas&quot;: embedded in the community by its social arms, and driven to suicide bombing by Israeli intransigence. [Yet] Hroub is not afraid to voice criticism or disquiet.' Guardian\n\n'This book could not be timelier. Khaled Hroub expertly answers every important question about Hamas and insightfully explains its ideology, organisation and appeal. Concise, lucid and invaluable.' James Piscatori, Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies\n\nThe U.S. views Hamas as a terrorist organisation. Yet, to the great surprise of many, Hamas swept to victory in the 2006 Palestinian Authority elections. Hamas is now a democractically elected political party.\n\nThis is the first beginner's guide to this controversial political organisation.
