He argues that humankind is at a turning point in history. In this century, we are going to make the historic transition from the &amp;#039;Age of Discovery&amp;#039; to the &amp;#039;Age of Mastery&amp;#039;, a period in which we will move from being passive observers of nature to its active choreographers. This will give us not only unparalleled possibilities but also great responsibilities.\n\nThe Biotech Revolution\n\nFirst aired Monday 12 November 2007 21:00-22:00 BBC Four\n\nGenetics and biotechnology promise a future of unprecedented health and longevity: DNA screening could prevent many diseases, gene therapy could cure them and, thanks to lab-grown organs, the human body could be repaired as easily as a car, with spare parts readily available. Ultimately, the ageing process itself could be slowed down or even halted.\n\nBut what impact will this have on who we are and how we will live? And, with our mastery of the genome, will the human race end up in a world divided by genetic apartheid?\n\n\nTechnical Specs :\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Filesize : 745 MB (for each of 3 parts)\n- Duration : 59 min\n- XviD encoded.\n- Video bitrate : 1638 Kb/s\n- Resoulution : 672 x 384 (16:9)\n- Audio Codec : VBR mp3\n\n- Ripped by : Adam Cook\n\n\n...
