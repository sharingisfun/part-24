He commands his audience with twisted little aphorisms, &quot;the sort of thing you might find in a fortune cookie baked by Satan&quot; with no-one escaping his biting wit and take no prisoners approach to subject matter.\n\nRecorded live at London&amp;#039;s Bloomsbury Theatre, Jimmy walks a fine line with truly outrageous gags that would be thoroughly offensive if not so expertly delivered with an ironic glint in his eye.\n\nAs Jimmy explains: &quot;This DVD is exactly the same as last year&amp;#039;s except every single word. It&amp;#039;s rude, crude and offensive but those aren&amp;#039;t the only reasons you&amp;#039;ll enjoy it.&quot;\n\n\nExtras:\n#  Removed\n\n\n    * Aspect Ratio 16:9\n\n    * PAL (25fps)\n\n    * English\t\n\n\n\n-- Note: due to firewall restrictions I cannot accept incoming connections, but rest assured I will eventually connect to you in all my 100Mbit glory! --","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdfe5b7edee2a5861cb9a940986662741d65f547","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Carr+-+In+Concert+%28XVID+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdfe5b7edee2a5861cb9a940986662741d65f547","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,254,91,126,222,226,165,134,28,185,169,64,152,102,98,116,29,101,245,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
