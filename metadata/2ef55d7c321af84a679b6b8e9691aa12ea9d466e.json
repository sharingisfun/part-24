Living After Midnight\n\nNotes from original dimeadozen uploader:  The band certainly did not disappoint us with this killer setlist and performance.  \nNow, that's how you do a final world tour!  I taped from the back of the arena, lower level \njust right of center.  The crowd around me was pretty well-behaved, and the sound in this\nvenue is always good.  They sure don't make arenas like they used to.  If you get a chance\nto see the Priest on the Epitaph tour, do yourself a favor and go.  Enjoy!\n\nNotes from TPB uploader:\nSounds a bit washed-out due to the taper's distance, but still very clear.\n\n* Making a DIME torrent available on TPB\n* Put in clearer filenames and metadata\n* Did not edit the audio at all\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ef55d7c321af84a679b6b8e9691aa12ea9d466e","amp;dn":"Judas+Priest+Epitaph+Tour+Live+%2F+Bootleg+-+2011.11.08+-+Cincinna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ef55d7c321af84a679b6b8e9691aa12ea9d466e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,245,93,124,50,26,248,74,103,155,107,142,150,145,170,18,234,157,70,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
