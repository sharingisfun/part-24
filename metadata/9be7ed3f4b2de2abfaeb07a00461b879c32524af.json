Space Strategy sim reminiscent of games such as Homeworld, but largely simplified.\n\nNot in english, but according to Wikipedia, will be officially localized &quot;One of these days.&quot;\n\nStill, does not require any knowledge of Japanese to play. Extremely straight-forward.\n\nNo copy protection.
