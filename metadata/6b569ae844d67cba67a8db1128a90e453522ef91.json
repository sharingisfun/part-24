He's not very bright and hasn't made much of himself so far. He is very much in love with Leah Maitland though she has told him she doesn't want to see him anymore. He thinks she won't see him because her father doesn't approve and that they both think she can do better. When he realizes he can actually exchange parts of himself, like his age, with others he sets out on a path to make himself more acceptable to both of them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b569ae844d67cba67a8db1128a90e453522ef91","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+%3D+The+Self+Improvement+Of+Salvadore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b569ae844d67cba67a8db1128a90e453522ef91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,86,154,232,68,214,124,186,103,168,219,17,40,169,14,69,53,34,239,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
