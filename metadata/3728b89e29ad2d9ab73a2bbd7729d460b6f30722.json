It was released in an alternate 3-CD version (as opposed to the usual 2-CD) and slightly different versions in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number 12 on November 30, 2002. It spent 67 weeks on the chart. It was certified gold and platinum in December 2002, 2x platinum in March 2003, 3x platinum in August 2004 and 4x and 5x platinum in February 2011 by the RIAA.\n\nIt was the first Elton John compilation released since the time that PolyGram, which had controlled the pre-1976 Elton John catalogue, was sold to Universal Music Group, which controlled the post-1976 recordings. Prior to 1992, rights to John's music had been complicated as they shifted between various companies. UMG now owns worldwide distribution rights to all of John's music, while sharing overall ownership with John himself\n\nAll songs written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin unless otherwise noted.\n\nGreatest hits album by Elton John\nReleased November 11, 2002\nRecorded 1970-2002\nGenre Rock\nLength 156:46\nLabel UTV Records\n\nChart (2002) Peak\nposition\nItalian Top 20 Albums[1] 13\nNew Zealand Top 40 Albums[2] 8\nNorwegian Top 40 Albums[3] 6\nUK Albums Chart[4] 3\nUS Billboard 200[5] 12\nChart (2003) Peak\nposition\nAustralian Top 50 Albums[6] 6\nAustrian Top 75 Albums[7] 19\nBelgium (Flanders) 100 Albums[8] 8\nBelgium (Wallonia) 100 Albums[9] 30\nDanish Top 40 Albums[10] 2\nFrench Compilations[11] 3\nGerman Albums[12] 19\nNetherlands Top 100 Albums[13] 14\nSwedish Top 60 Albums[14] 12\nSwiss Top 100 Albums[15] 12\n\nBit Rate.....211kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3728b89e29ad2d9ab73a2bbd7729d460b6f30722","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Greatest+Hits+1970+-+2002+%2B+Bonus+Disc+%282002%29.+butc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3728b89e29ad2d9ab73a2bbd7729d460b6f30722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,40,184,158,41,173,45,154,183,58,43,189,119,41,212,96,182,243,7,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
