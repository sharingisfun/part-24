Cardinal Timothy Dolan sent a letter on Friday to all the Catholic bishops \nof the United States stating the Catholic Church will fight President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s healthcare mandate that the church pay for\n contraceptives. Rather than cover this development, the media ran wild with RushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s insensitive comments.\n\n Also, the Journal of Medical Ethics says newborn babies are not Ã¢â‚¬Å“actual personsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and do not have a Ã¢â‚¬Å“moral right to lifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. \nThe ethicists also argue that parents should be able to have their baby killed if it turns out to be disabled when it is\n born.\n\n\nPrager 20120305  2 Buying Votes\n\nPrager H2 Charlie Sykes fills in for Dennis. Entitlements used to be coupled with a work component, \nbut due to the explosion of welfare in the 60's, government assistance has become a vehicle to appease the masses. \nThe left wing media has pounced all over Rush Limbaugh for his contraception remarks but no one on the left is being \nheld to the fire for their hate-filled comments about the passing of Andrew Breitbart.\n\n\nPrager 20120305  1 A Nation of Moochers\n\nPrager H1 Charlie Sykes fills in for Dennis. Charlie points out that last year there were more people working for the\n government than in the manufacturing sector, we have become a nation of takers rather than makers. Callers weigh in.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1175167c60d9938760c47a3b3e95316be9039c3d","amp;dn":"The+Dennis+Prager+Radio+Show+MAR-05-2012+MON+CF+64K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1175167c60d9938760c47a3b3e95316be9039c3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,117,22,124,96,217,147,135,96,196,122,59,62,149,49,107,233,3,156,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
