Along with her twin-brother, Griffin, Ellie has spent most of her life hiding from the Vyusher, a rival tribe who destroyed their entire powerful family. But after a mysterious dream, Ellie risks discovery in order to find and watch over the Jenners, another group of similarly gifted people. She refuses to let them suffer the same fate.\nAlex Jenner has come home to protect his family. His adopted mother can sense danger coming, but not who or when. Suspicious of the new girl in town, Alex challenges Ellie in ways that will spark one of two possible outcomes: they'll spontaneously combust, or she'll lose control of the one power she's fought so hard to contain.\nWhen the Vyusher once again threaten everything she holds dear, Ellie will have to face her worst fear, and Alex will have to face an impossible decision. In this fairytale, the dragon that the prince must slay is also the princess who holds his heart.\n\nBook 2\nSelene sacrificed everything when she took her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place as ruler of the Vyusher, including her secret love for her one-time adversary Griffin Aubrey. When nightmares that are just a little too real start, Selene fears sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turned into a cold-blooded killerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦the monster that Griffin thinks she is.\nGriffin and Ellie Aubrey are finally safe for the first time in over a hundred years. But when an unknown menace drives Selene to leave her family and ask for help, Griffin must decide. Can he move past his hatred of everything she is? Or will the bond that could bring them both the greatest joy now be the source of their deepest despair?\nThe threat of the danger stalking Selene in her dreams might be too much even for this powerful group. And Griffin doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to easily forgive the woman he blames for killing his familyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nBook 3\nWhen Lila Jenner leaves her family and friends to start a new life for herself, Ramsey Pierce lets her go. Determined that the fire raging inside him will never harm her, he denies the magical bond that could be theirs alone.\nWhen an old enemy resurfaces and Lila suddenly disappears, Ramsey realizes that he'll do anything to win her back and keep her safe beside him. But Maddox, driven by a centuries-old quest for revenge, is stronger than they ever imagined. And Lila could be the key to his ultimate power. \nFriends and enemies must band together against this shared threat if any of them are to survive. Even then, they may all discover too late that one dragon is not always enoughÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nGenre: Romance | Fantasy | Paranormal | Shapeshifters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ba4564fddbf2d9ebcd117c3b6625a72179d0818","amp;dn":"Abigail+Owen+-+Svatura+Series+%28Books+1+-+3%29+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ba4564fddbf2d9ebcd117c3b6625a72179d0818","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,164,86,79,221,191,45,158,188,209,23,195,182,98,90,114,23,157,8,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
