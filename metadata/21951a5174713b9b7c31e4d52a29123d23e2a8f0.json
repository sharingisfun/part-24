From the curmudgeonly complaints of his elderly friend to the hilarious rants of his purple pal from the Micronesian Islands and a jalapeno pepper with a self-effacing sense of humor, there's no shortage of aching sides when Dunham takes the stage. Parents be warned though, Dunham's edgy sense of humor certainly isn't for the small fry. \n\nRipped with Handbrake\n\nLength: 1 Hour 10 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21951a5174713b9b7c31e4d52a29123d23e2a8f0","amp;dn":"Jeff+Dunham%3A+Arguing+With+Myself%282005%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21951a5174713b9b7c31e4d52a29123d23e2a8f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,149,26,81,116,113,59,155,124,49,228,213,42,41,18,61,35,226,168,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
