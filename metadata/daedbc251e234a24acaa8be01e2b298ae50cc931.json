The Maguire  \n                    men refuse to let one of their own be struck  \n                    down so decide to take matters into their own  \n                    hands and get their heads together to come up  \n                    with a sticky solution. Although Shane is keen  \n                    to take up their offer Kelly refuses, and with  \n                    Liam's help, both realise the answer to their  \n                    problem lies closer to home. Carl and Chesney  \n                    return to the Chatsworth and live undercover in  \n                    Joe's storeroom. When Maxine discovers the boys  \n                    are back, she risks her relationship with Ian  \n                    by secretly concocting a plan to get them out  \n                    of trouble. Carl prefers a more direct option,  \n                    which puts all the Gallaghers in danger.
