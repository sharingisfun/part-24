Had it not been for his untimely death at the age of 33 he may well have gone on to challenge for the World Championship. In the only book on Pillsbury currently in print Grandmaster Alexander Cherniaev presents 50 of his best games and shows why he ranks alongside Morphy and Fischer as one of the greatest ever American players.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Harry-Nelson-Pillsbury-December-1872/dp/5903229034/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351530321&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=harry+nelson+pillsbury&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Harry-Nelson-Pillsbury-December-1872/dp/5903229034/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351530321&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=harry+nelson+pillsbury&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf9443c98625da2e72ddd85f203ca68918841414","amp;dn":"Harry+Nelson+Pillsbury+%28+5+December+1872+-+17+June+1906%29%3A+A+Geni","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf9443c98625da2e72ddd85f203ca68918841414","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,148,67,201,134,37,218,46,114,221,216,95,32,60,166,137,24,132,20,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
