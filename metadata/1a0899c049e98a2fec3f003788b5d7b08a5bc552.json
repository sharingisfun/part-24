Preceded by the powerful single &quot;Avenging Angels,&quot; the expectations were set high. What actually was delivered, however, is more of the same with a slight twist. Tin Planet is not very different from Spiders, apart from the fact that some of the more Bacharachian influences seem to have succumbed to disco. The album includes several standout tracks, including the duet in &quot;The Ballad of Tom Jones&quot; with Cerys Matthews of Catatonia. Also, there's the conventional pop of &quot;1 O'Clock&quot; and several traditionally Space-y tracks like &quot;Begin Again,&quot; the paranoid &quot;Be There,&quot; and &quot;Bad Days.&quot; It's an album that fans will adore (especially after repeated listens), but is unlikely to impress any new listeners.
