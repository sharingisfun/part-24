The story, written by creative mind Mike Wolfer (Lady Death, Gravel), is a completely ground-level introduction to new readers; they will not need any prior knowledge of the characters Pandora, Hellina, or Widow in order to read the new series.\n\nDescribing the new direction for the character Pandora in the WAR GODDESS series, writer Mike Wolfer says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We pick up the story many years after Pandora accomplished her centuries-long struggle to contain the evils she set loose upon the Earth. The immortal War Goddess has retired, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve concocted a totally new threat, with enemies and villains like the Earth has never seen, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a whole new war that must be waged. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d probably hate to admit it, but Pandora canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fight this war alone.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The overwhelming threat to humanity posed in the series forces her to recruit other cult classic female fatales into her conflict.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:518382df9653896af48ef878c30d23912e675670","amp;dn":"War+Goddess+%28000+-+012+%2B+Variant+Covers%29+%28complete%29+%28-+Nem+-%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"518382df9653896af48ef878c30d23912e675670","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,131,130,223,150,83,137,106,244,142,248,120,195,13,35,145,46,103,86,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
