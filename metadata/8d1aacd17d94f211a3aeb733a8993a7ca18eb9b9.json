For many years, Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke were known as the &quot;Big Three&quot; of science fiction.\n\nClarke served in the Royal Air Force as a radar instructor and technician from 1941ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1946. He proposed a satellite communication system in 1945 which won him the Franklin Institute Stuart Ballantine Gold Medal in 1963. He was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1947ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1950 and again in 1953.\n\nClarke emigrated to Sri Lanka in 1956 largely to pursue his interest in scuba diving; that year, he discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee. He lived in Sri Lanka until his death. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998, and was awarded Sri Lanka's highest civil honour, Sri Lankabhimanya, in 2005.\n\n\nThe readers\n\nRoger May\n\nRoger May trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre and has gone on to perform in a number of roles in films, television and the theatre, including the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford.
