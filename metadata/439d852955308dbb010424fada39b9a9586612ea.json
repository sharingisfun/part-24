After the crushing Yorkist victory at Towton in 1461, King Edward IV appeared to have triumphed in EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bloody Wars of the Roses (1455-1485). The Lancastrian King Henry VI was even a prisoner in the Tower of London. By 1470, however, EdwardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s erstwhile ally the Earl of Warwick Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Ã¢â‚¬ËœKingmakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ had joined the Lancastrians and a final reckoning was inevitable. Warwick perished at Barnet in April 1471, and on 4 May Edward confronted his enemies, including Edward, Prince and last hope of the House of Lancaster, at Tewkesbury","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:439d852955308dbb010424fada39b9a9586612ea","amp;dn":"Tewkesbury+1471%3A+The+Last+Yorkist+Victory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"439d852955308dbb010424fada39b9a9586612ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,157,133,41,85,48,141,187,1,4,36,250,218,57,185,169,88,102,18,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
