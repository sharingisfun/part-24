Borowko (Marcel Dekker, 2000).djvu\r\n\r\nThis volume presents computer simulation methods and mathematical modelling of physical processes used in surface science research. It offers in-depth analysis of advanced theoretical approaches to behaviours of fluids in contact with porous, semiporous and nonporous solid surfaces. The book also explores interfacial systems for a wide variety of phenomena, including: absorption, flotation, osmosis, and colloidal stability","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f898ea18fdba106b65a30bb96d22c2a6a2ebfaf6","amp;dn":"Computational+Methods+in+Surface+and+Colloid+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f898ea18fdba106b65a30bb96d22c2a6a2ebfaf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,152,234,24,253,186,16,107,101,163,11,185,109,34,194,166,162,235,250,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
