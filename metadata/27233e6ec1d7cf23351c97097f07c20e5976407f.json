Adolescents - Adolescents (1981)\n\nAdolescents (often called The Blue Album) is the eponymous debut album by the Orange County punk rock band the Adolescents. The album boasts an all-star cast, featuring three past Social Distortion members, (Rikk Agnew, Frank Agnew and Casey Royer); former Agent Orange bassist Steve Soto; and a previously unknown singer named Tony Cadena. It was the only Adolescents album co-produced by Mike Patton (not to be confused with the lead singer of Faith No More) and Thom Wilson, and was released in May 1981 on Frontier Records. It was also the band's only album released before their five-year hiatus.\nReleased during the breakthrough era for hardcore punk, the album brought the band a small amount of success in their hometown as they started to gather a following. &quot;Amoeba&quot; was released as a radio single to promote the album. Adolescents is now considered a classic punk album by fans and critics alike. In California punk sales, it second only to the Dead Kennedys' Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables. (wikipedia)\n\n\nThe first and best wave of L.A. punk bands from 1977-1979 all broke up under-documented and unsigned, with the exception of X, the Germs, and, to a lesser extent, the Plugz. But the legacy of incredible pioneers such as the Weirdos, Dils, Controllers, and Screamers was the wide success of the harder, faster, younger bands that followed. The interest the 1977 bands awakened not only inspired the formation of Black Flag, Circle Jerks, T.S.O.L., Social Distortion, Agent Orange, Fear, the Adolescents, and others, but helped create a national market, enabling the newer bands to find labels, put out albums, and tour regularly. \nThe Adolescents were perhaps the first of this second wave to put out an LP widely distributed throughout the U.S., selling well over five digits in 1981 (following on the heels of San Francisco's Dead Kennedys, who broke the doors open with their immortal Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables the previous year). Produced by Middle Class' Mike Patton, the debut from these five Orange County kids established the mid-tempo, punk-pop &quot;Southern Cal sound,&quot; led by the long, great, pummeling, Johnny Thunders-derived solos of the two Agnew brothers, Rikk and Frank. \nThese soaring, ripping parts still sound great today. As important, songs such as the anthemic &quot;No Way,&quot; the classic &quot;Amoeba,&quot; the schizophrenic &quot;Kids of the Black Hole,&quot; and the glorious &quot;Creatures&quot; endure precisely because they're not just aggressive and speedy: they're super-catchy, heavy-riffing rock &amp; roll, proving again that punk was the true heir to the likes of Chuck Berry, Larry Williams, Bo Diddley, and Eddie Cochran. \nFor the longest while, L.A. teenagers had the spirit, verve, moxie, and zeal to play charged, zippy punk. Hundreds of other bands formed right as the Adolescents recorded, such as Bad Religion, Shattered Faith, Youth Brigade, Aggression, M.I.A., and Channel 3! In so doing, L.A. helped resist the diluted explosion of thrash hardcore that swept the rest of the U.S., particularly on the East Coast.

Adolescents - Welcome To Reality EP (1981)\n\nAfter Rikk Agnew left to pursue a solo career and contribute to another classic debut album, L.A. death-rock legends Christian Death's Only Theatre of Pain, the rest of the band recruited drummer Royer's roommate Steve Roberts on guitar and released this EP the year after the group's debut. The title track is a fairly indifferent fear-of-the-bomb rant, while &quot;Losing Battle&quot; and &quot;Things Start Moving&quot; have the same general pace of the band's best early songs, though not the same immediate memorability (even if the latter has an attractive, slightly droning guitar opening). It's a bit of a nothing way of bowing out, which the fivesome did shortly thereafter, at least for the first time around.

Rikk Agnew - All By Myself (1982)\n\nSnarkily titled after Eric Carmen's '70s solo hit but thankfully not featuring a cover of that song, Agnew's solo debut actually lives up to its title completely, as he plays every instrument on the record, creating a great one-man band sound (with the help of Adolescents producer Thom Wilson) as a result. \nPossessed of a good mid-range punk voice -- no sneering or bellowing, not really singing but not just talking over the songs either -- he creates the same basic rush he brought to his early stints in the Adolescents and the faster Christian Death songs he worked on, but with a slightly poppier bent at points that perfectly balances sass and strength, while not being afraid to experiment from time to time either (as the lengthy album closer &quot;Section 8&quot; shows). \n&quot;Everyday,&quot; the one track Agnew cowrote with someone else (his brother and fellow Adolescents veteran Frank), is a great example of this, with its gentler pace, tight arrangement that lets some space into the playing, and Agnew's actual singing, which succeeds in a slightly winsome way. The leadoff track is yet another Orange County punk classic from Agnew's pen, &quot;OC Life,&quot; specifically naming some particularly crap cities worthy of contempt, and from there he's off relentlessly detailing some particularly screwed up lives and problems with a withering eye. \nMore than most who have worked in punk, Agnew can capture a careful empathy when at his best, backed up with memorable music to boot (the fragile keyboard arrangement that fills out the sound on the remarkable character study &quot;10&quot; is particularly lovely touch). &quot;Surfside&quot; sneaks in a surf riff (but of course!) into its otherwise trebly and tense look back at a destructive, unsettled past, a smart way of combining nostalgia with a questioning bent, another fine moment on a generally fine record.
