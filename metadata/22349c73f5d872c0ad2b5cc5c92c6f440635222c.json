Highway 61 Revisited was such a turning point, a defining moment: the point where Bob Dylan dropped the folk mystique and went straight-ahead into rock. After this, it was evident that rock and roll had meaning, that it was a viable art form. Here Dylan transcend popular music and sent it spinning into areas artists are still exploring. One of Dylan's most defining albums and a ticket to immortality. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 21\nArtist: Bob Dylan\nAlbum: Highway 61 Revisited\nYear: 1967\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22349c73f5d872c0ad2b5cc5c92c6f440635222c","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Highway+61+Revisited+%5BFLAC-1967%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22349c73f5d872c0ad2b5cc5c92c6f440635222c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,52,156,115,245,216,114,192,173,43,92,197,201,44,111,68,6,53,34,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
