There were echoes of the (acid-rock) past but they were ethereal, sleepy, ghostly: they had been reduced to an inner language of the subconscious. The setting was a wasteland roamed by zombies devoid of any passion, resigned to their emotional impotence and moral isolation, capable only of articulating the emptiness of their lives in a vocabulary of negative words. These were confessions of people who did not even know anymore how to grieve for their own sorrow. These dirges were the exact opposite of the anthemic call to arms of rock&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;roll. - Piero Scaruffi -\n\n\nScans have not been descreened \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Fire_(Galaxie_500_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Fire_(Galaxie_500_album)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03bd02d84b8157c2969df3c4c6f070dc6b86d66e","amp;dn":"Galaxie+500+-+On+Fire+%281989%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03bd02d84b8157c2969df3c4c6f070dc6b86d66e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,189,2,216,75,129,87,194,150,157,243,196,198,240,112,220,107,134,214,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
