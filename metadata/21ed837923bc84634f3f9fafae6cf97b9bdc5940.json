Developed by Canadian studio Radical Entertainment and published by Activision, it is the sequel to 2009's Prototype. The game was announced at the 2010 Spike VGA Awards with the tagline &quot;Murder your Maker.&quot;[5]\nThe game features a new protagonist, James Heller, as he goes on a quest to destroy the Blacklight virus. The story is also one of revenge, as Heller wants to kill Alex Mercer, protagonist of the original Prototype, after his family was killed in the outbreak of the Blacklight virus. While the game was a top seller for a period of time, its sales would eventually result in the downsizing of its developer.\n\nIF YOU LIKE MY TORRENTS LOOK AT MY BRO'S TORRENTS \n\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/ChivveZ/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/ChivveZ/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ed837923bc84634f3f9fafae6cf97b9bdc5940","amp;dn":"Prototype+2+PSN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ed837923bc84634f3f9fafae6cf97b9bdc5940","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,237,131,121,35,188,132,99,79,63,159,175,174,108,249,123,155,220,89,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
