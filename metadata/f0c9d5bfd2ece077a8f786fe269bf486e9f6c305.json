Written by David P. Aguilar Jr, PhD. \n\nWritten from the perspective of an angel (a different one in each book), these books cover various events in Judeo-Christian history, such as the internal dynamics of the fall of Lucifer, the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve, the flood, the exodus, etc. Each book details these events through the eyes of an angel dealing with the unseen conflict &quot;behind the scenes&quot; - demons wrestling for control of the people in the middle. \n\nA great series, definitely worth a read whether you are religious or not. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0c9d5bfd2ece077a8f786fe269bf486e9f6c305","amp;dn":"The+Sarim+Chronicles+-+David+P.+Aguilar+Jr.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0c9d5bfd2ece077a8f786fe269bf486e9f6c305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,201,213,191,210,236,224,119,168,247,134,254,38,155,244,134,233,246,195,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
