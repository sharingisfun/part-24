( 2 times out of focus for 10 secs too btw,\nnothing to worry though)\n\nso i cut out that 14 mins and treated them as needed\nnormally a good way would be to crop them away and resize, but than you would loose\na lot video below too, and\nsince video isnt the best it looked worse, so i decided to do a workaround that.\nfixed the skew, cropped 2 lines above and below to get it straightened and changed\naspect to fit rest of the video.\nso for the first 14 mins you have now same video just other aspect but nothing is\nstretched or unnneeded cropped\nlooks perfect like this, afterwards video is nice till the end.\nyou wont notice the aspect change whilest watching.\n\nafter i had full video i fixed brightness,contrast,hue,saturation and removed the\nnoise in the video.\n\nAudio:\n\nwas sweet line, sounds very nice, lipsynced to video\n\noverall i would say if you cant wait to watch it(like me) this is a decent version\nnow for you to get here. (watched it on 52&quot;, was ok to watch, got used to the\nflicker after half an hour)\nif you want to wait for a non flickering version you might need to wait a very good\nweek - up to you!!\n\nincluded 2 samples, 1 within the first 14mins where you can see the added borders,\nthe other is from rest of the video\n\nstill got nice\nenjoy\n\nIMDB Info:\n\nName: The Hangover Part III\nGenre: Comedy\nIMDB Link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1951261/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1951261/&lt;/a&gt;  \nIMDB Rating: 6.3/10 from 15,026 users\nDirector: Todd Phillips\nWriters: Todd Phillips, Craig Mazin\nCast: Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis\nPlot: This time, there's no wedding.
