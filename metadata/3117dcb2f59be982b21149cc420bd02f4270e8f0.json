Please tell me what you think :)\n\n\nIf you're uploading this to other torrent sites, please at least paste link leading to this site :) \nor write something like: &quot;It's not my screenplay... I found it on PirateBay blah blah :)&quot;\n\n\nPS: I already have a story for a sequel (more Eldars) in my head and also opening scene for third and last part (Tyranid's full scale invasion).\n\n\nCheers :)\n\nKamil WoÃ…Âºniak aka kamil108\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3117dcb2f59be982b21149cc420bd02f4270e8f0","amp;dn":"WARHAMMER+40K+SPACE+MARINES+-+MY+SCREENPLAY+%5BENG%2FPL%2C+.DOCX%2C+.PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3117dcb2f59be982b21149cc420bd02f4270e8f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,23,220,178,245,155,233,130,178,17,73,204,66,11,208,47,66,112,232,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
