When a high-ranking spy named Tatewaki Koriyama defects from the shogun to a rival clan, however, the world of swordsmen is thrown into turmoil. After Sasuke is unwittingly drawn into the conflict, he tracks Tatewaki, while a mysterious, white-hooded figure seems to hunt them both. By taleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end, no one is who they seemed to be, and the truth is far more personal than anyone suspected. Director Masahiro ShinodaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Samurai Spy, filled with clan intrigue, ninja spies, and multiple double crosses, marks a bold stylistic departure from swordplay film convention.\n\n__________________________________\n\nSize : 699 MB \nEnglish subs : .idx/.srt \n\nvideo codec ] \nXVid \n608x272 (2.24:1) \n862 kb/s \nFPS 23.976 \n\naudio codec : \nMPEG-1 Layer 3 \n108 kb/s (54/ch, stereo) \n48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:002abc7024221407f742ccc29d76a7983e37b08e","amp;dn":"Samurai+Spy+%28Masahiro+Shinoda%2C+1965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"002abc7024221407f742ccc29d76a7983e37b08e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,42,188,112,36,34,20,7,247,66,204,194,157,118,167,152,62,55,176,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
