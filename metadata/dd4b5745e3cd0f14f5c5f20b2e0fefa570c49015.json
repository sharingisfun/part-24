It is an intricately detailed, realistic bass fishing game and the first fishing title to incorporate level-based gameplay. Challenging for beginners and seasoned anglers, these bass jump, shake and roll to throw the lure. The dynamic camera movement features simultaneous above-water and underwater views where players can see the fish and tease them to strike. Play in either professional bass tournaments or just fish recreationally using your choice of fishing lures, rods and reels.\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To CD\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd4b5745e3cd0f14f5c5f20b2e0fefa570c49015","amp;dn":"Championship.Bass.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd4b5745e3cd0f14f5c5f20b2e0fefa570c49015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,75,87,69,227,205,15,20,245,197,242,11,46,15,239,165,112,196,144,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
