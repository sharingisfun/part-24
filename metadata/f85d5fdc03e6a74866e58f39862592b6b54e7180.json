Indeed there are some, including many contributors to this book, who would argue that the evidence of a great but forgotten fountainhead of civilization is overwhelming and needs, at last, to be given its proper due.\nForbidden History, a compilation of essays gathered over time from the magazine Atlantis Rising, aims to put forward such evidence, and to propose ideas and theories with regard to the origins of life and the human race itself that may very well be more in accordance with reality than currently prevailing orthodoxy. In proposing these ideas, we hope to pose some interesting and provocative questions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f85d5fdc03e6a74866e58f39862592b6b54e7180","amp;dn":"Forbidden+History+by+J.+Douglas+Kenyon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f85d5fdc03e6a74866e58f39862592b6b54e7180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,93,95,220,3,230,167,72,102,229,143,57,134,37,146,182,181,78,113,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
