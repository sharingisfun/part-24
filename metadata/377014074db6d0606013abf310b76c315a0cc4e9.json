David Byrne and his band, before â€œRemain In Lightâ€, had gained a lot of attention in the post-punk scene, for being the most eclectic and experimental outfit that was labeled punk around. In 1980 though Talking Heads outdid themselves, creating a timeless masterpiece that even today is hard to match.  \r\n\r\nThe structure of the album is extremely original, having never seen something this conceptual, with the exception of Byrne and Enoâ€™s solo album â€œMy Life In The Bush Of Ghostsâ€, â€œRemain In Lightâ€s twin, released the following year. The first three songs have an overall cheerful mood, and an ascending tempo from song to song; â€œBorn To Punchesâ€ is moderate, â€œCrosseyed and Painlessâ€ fast, â€œThe Great Curveâ€ very fast. These three songs represent the lighter side. â€œOnce In A Lifetimeâ€ is  in the exact middle of the album; itâ€™s mysterious but very fascinating in the verse, bright and happy sounding in the chorus. This is in a way an anticipation to the second half of the album, which starts with â€œHouses In Motionâ€, a half-Spoken Word song, very tense and sort of creepy in the verse thanks to the abstract beats and arrangements, but it still has a pretty cheerful chorus. Things get darker with â€œSeen and Not Seenâ€, lyrically very fascinating, musically mysterious and a little gloomy too. This one though is pretty much all Spoken Word. â€œListening Windâ€ is very mellow, melancholic, and sad sounding, and lyrically it is in my opinion the best song here, being a story about a native American living in America, seeing  all the new inhabitants of his town and wanting to burn every building down. So far the darkness in the second part of the album got more present with each song; coherently wih the theme and struture of the album,â€œThe Overloadâ€ is probably one of the darkest and gloomiest songs Iâ€™ve ever heard. Bleak, agonic, this song is a masterpiece and simply the only one that could have ended â€œRemain In Lightâ€.\r\n\r\nThis is an absolute must listen. An essential masterpiece that everybody should be aware of and appreciate. That way, maybe the world could rise from the gray for a little bit and remain, just for a little bit, in light.
