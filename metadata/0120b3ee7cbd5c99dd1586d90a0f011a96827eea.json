A popular feature adapted into many forms of media, including television and film, it stars a costumed crimefighter operating from the African jungle. The series began with a daily newspaper strip on February 17, 1936, followed by a color Sunday strip on May 28, 1939; both are still running as of 2008.\n\nLee Falk died in 1999. As of 2008, the comic strip is produced by writer Tony DePaul and artist Paul Ryan. Previous artists on the newspaper strip include Ray Moore, Wilson McCoy, Bill Lignante, Sy Barry, George Olesen, Keith Williams, Fred Fredericks and Graham Nolan.\n\nNew Phantom stories are also published in comic books in different parts of the world, among them by Moonstone Books in U.S., Egmont in Scandinavia, Frew in Australia and Eurobooks (Egmont imprint) in India.\n\nWhile the Phantom is not the first fictional costumed crimefighter, he is the first to wear the skintight costume that has become a hallmark of comic-book superheroes, and the first to wear a mask with no visible pupils, another superhero standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Strips from D059 Queen Sansamor and the sixth man)\n\n\nThe Phantom started as a daily strip on February 17, 1936, with the story &quot;The Singh Brotherhood&quot;, written by Falk and drawn first by him, for two weeks, followed by Ray Moore, who was an assistant to artist Phil Davis on Falk&amp;#039;s Mandrake the Magician strip. A Sunday Phantom strip was added May 28, 1939.\n\nDuring World War II, Falk joined the Office of War Information, where he became chief of his radio foreign language division. Moore also served in the war, during which he left the strip to his assistant Wilson McCoy. On Moore&amp;#039;s return, he worked on the strip on and off until 1949, when McCoy succeeded him. During McCoy&amp;#039;s tenure, the strip appeared in thousands of newspapers worldwide, and The Phantom strip was smuggled by boats into the Nazi-occupied Norway during World War II. The word &quot;Phantom &quot; was also used as a password for the Norwegian Resistance, leading the character to receive iconic status in the country.\n\nMcCoy died suddenly in 1961. Carmine Infantino and Bill Lignante (who would later draw Phantom stories directly for comic books) filled in before a successor was found in Sy Barry. During Barry&amp;#039;s early years, he and Falk modernized the strip, and laid the foundation for what is considered the modern look of the Phantom. Barry would continue working on the strip for over 30 years before retiring in 1994.\n\nBarry&amp;#039;s longtime assistant George Olesen remained on the strip as penciller, with Keith Williams joining as inker for the daily strip. The Sunday strip was inked by Eric Doescher until Mandrake the Magician artist Fred Fredericks became the regular inker in 1995.\n\nFalk continued to script Phantom (and Mandrake) until his death on March 13, 1999. His last daily and Sunday strip stories, &quot;Terror at the Opera&quot; and &quot;The Kidnappers&quot;, respectively, were finished by his wife, Elizabeth Falk.[4] After Falk&amp;#039;s passing, King Features Syndicate began to cooperate with European comic publisher Egmont, publisher of the Swedish Fantomen magazine, which now went from only publishing Phantom stories in licenced comic books to providing the stories for the newspaper strip as well, by adapting their own Phantom comic book stories into the comic strip format. Fantomen writers Tony De Paul and Claes Reimerthi alternated as writers of the newspaper strip after Falk died, with De Paul handling the daily strips and Reimerthi being responsible for the Sunday strips. As of 2008, De Paul is the regular writer. Some of the stories have been adapted from comic magazine stories originally published in Fantomen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0120b3ee7cbd5c99dd1586d90a0f011a96827eea","amp;dn":"The+Phantom+dailies+part+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0120b3ee7cbd5c99dd1586d90a0f011a96827eea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,32,179,238,124,189,92,153,221,21,134,217,10,15,1,26,150,130,126,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
