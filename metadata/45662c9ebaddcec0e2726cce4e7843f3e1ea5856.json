After a very pleasant listen to a few of Rosey&amp;#039;s tracks on her website and myspace page, it became clear that finding her albums came next. Surprisingly, instead of torrents I found mp3 archives on some file storage sites and they sounded great.

She soaks herself in its beauty and works against its complexities for a magical carpet ride of emotion. It&amp;#039;s distinctly focused with an urban appeal while rooted in rock, and a bit comparable to the likes of Poe, Fiona Apple, and Beth Orton. Rosey writes from the heart and it works brilliantly. The narratives of passion, loss, and personal understanding are bold without being naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve.\n\nSince we last heard from Rosey on that aforementioned 2002 freshman effort, her remarkable career has indeed taken many exciting twists and turns throughout several unconventional musical associations. Following instant national attention from her single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ landing on the Bridget JonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Diary soundtrack and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe AfterlifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ scoring a slot in the Farrelly BrothersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Shallow Hal, the tunesmith toured with the lauded likes of Melissa Etheridge and Morcheeba. Outside of her own interests, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also teamed up as a co-writer on many occasions, from hit maker Kelis to a number of burgeoning artists (with whom she doubles as a mentor) to writing jingles for commercials.\n\nSix years on from her debut, Rosey returns with her sophomore set. In the interim, a proposed covers album was scrapped after the singer decided a tribute album to her musical heroines made less sense than allowing their inspiration to work through her. The result is Luckiest Girl, an album that allows the singer/songwriter to explore at length her jazz influences.\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something undeniably seductive about jazz music- its glamour, sexuality and earnest, soulful roots all appeal to a comfortable, old-fashioned musical sensibility. Yet singer/songwriter Rosey is one of the select few who sees one step beyond the classic image and recognizes the genre as an entirely fresh form of pop music. A longtime jazz lover who began her eclectic career as a rock nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ soul siren on Island/Def Jam, Rosey is unique in her ability to find the delicate balance between both eras on The Luckiest Girl, her smoky, sensual, self-produced Quango debut.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI always dreamed of making timeless music, plus people have always told me my voice was well-suited to jazz and that I should try it,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ she shares...\n&quot;I knew I had to go full steam and write my own jazzy repertoire. I am a songwriter after all, so it just made more sense to do it that way&quot;...\n\nThe ensuing dozen selections vibrantly encapsulate those very goals, from the cocktail lounge grooves of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWho Am IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the vintage throwback of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThose EyesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the sassy seduction of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy Love.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Thematically the tunes take on a diverse swath of topics, including the music industry assessment ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a RuseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (which Rosey calls her word of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwarningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to up and coming acts), the growth obtained from an amicable break-up throughout ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Remember,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the wedding worthy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHand In Hand.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45662c9ebaddcec0e2726cce4e7843f3e1ea5856","amp;dn":"Rosey+2FullCDs+-+Dirty+Child+%2B+Luckiest+Girl+mp3+%5BQG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45662c9ebaddcec0e2726cce4e7843f3e1ea5856","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,102,44,158,186,221,206,192,226,114,108,206,78,120,67,243,225,234,88,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
