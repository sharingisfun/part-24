With the exception of Murderdolls touring guitarist Roman Surman, who contributed lead guitars to the album, and MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e guitarist Mick Mars, who makes guest appearances on the tracks &quot;Drug Me to Hell&quot; and &quot;Blood-Stained Valentine&quot;, the album was recorded by Wednesday 13 and Joey Jordison. The album was produced by Chris &quot;Zeuss&quot; Harris. In an interview for Metal Hammer, Jordison explained why the old lineup would not be returning:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ \t'The old band, we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even know each other before it all came together [...] It was dysfunctional but it worked, but this time, we wanted it to be a little more stable. It was apparent that if we were going to do The Murderdolls again, we were going to do it with everything weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got.' \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nOn June 17, 2010, on the Murderdolls Facebook page, the lead single from the album, titled &quot;My Dark Place Alone&quot;, was available for full preview on Bloody-Disgusting.com. On June 22, the single was made available for free download, for 48 hours only, from the Roadrunner website. Mock film trailers were released for three of the album's nonsingle tracks, &quot;Drug Me to Hell&quot;, &quot;Summertime Suicide&quot;, and &quot;Chapel of Blood&quot;.\n\nMurderdolls is an American horror punk supergroup, founded during 2002 in Hollywood, California. The band line-up consists of core members Wednesday 13 and Joey Jordison.
