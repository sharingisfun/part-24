Joined by his regular band of the period (guitarist Steve Erquiaga, bassist Keith Jones, drummer William Kennedy and percussionist Kenneth Nash), Narell once again shows how surprisingly flexible steel drums can be in jazz, pop, rock, and of course calypso settings. Any album that includes the title &quot;Brontosaurus Ballet&quot; is certainly worth exploring. \n~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide.\n\n\n:: Release Info ::\nRelease Date: 1987\nLabel: Windham Hill Records\nCatalog #: 370107-2\n\n\n:: Musicians ::\nAndy Narell: Steel Pan, Keyboards\nKenneth Nash: Bongos, Percussion, Congas\nSteve Erquiaga: Guitar, Guitar Synthesizer\nKeith Jones: Bass\nWilliam Kennedy: Drums\nDavid Rudder: Lead vocals on The Hammer\nKim Walker: Synthesizer, Keyboards\nPaul VanWageningen: Drums on The Hammer\nDavid Rudder, Carl Jacobs and Carol Jacobs: Background Vocals on The Hammer\n\n\n:: track list ::\n01.
