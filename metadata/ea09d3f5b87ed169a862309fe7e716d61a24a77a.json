His consistent style of presenting the theoretical structures lucidly unifies his testÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wide and well-chosen range of applications. I wish that all my students could take a course based on this book, and envy them the opportunity.&quot;\n\nMaxwell B. Stinchcombe, University of Texas at Austin\n\n&quot;This is a terrific book bringing together two strands in the recent literature on economic theory, namely game theory and the economics of asymmetric information. The style is brisk, the arguments are rigorous and it seems to be pitched at exactly the right level.&quot;\n\nPartha Dasgupta, University of Cambridge ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea09d3f5b87ed169a862309fe7e716d61a24a77a","amp;dn":"Games+and+Information%3A+An+Introduction+to+Game+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea09d3f5b87ed169a862309fe7e716d61a24a77a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,9,211,245,184,126,209,105,168,98,48,159,231,231,22,214,26,36,167,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
