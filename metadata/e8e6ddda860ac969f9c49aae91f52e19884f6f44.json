Standouts like Wasted World and I'm Sorry Baby, But You Can t Stand in My Light Anymore highlight an artist completing a cycle decades in the making, his talent undiminished, his perspective acute. Bob Mould is one of the most influential musicians of the alternative rock era, first for his early work with post-punks\nHusker Du, followed by the college rock-defining pop of Sugar and finally for his solo albums, notably his first, Workbook, which quieted Mould s previous ire to reveal his fine songwriting in a new light and allowed an introspective glimpse into the inner workings of an evolving artist. With Life and Times, Mould comes full circle, reclaiming his indie songwriting mantle from the generation of musicians he inspired.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8e6ddda860ac969f9c49aae91f52e19884f6f44","amp;dn":"Bob+Mould+-+Life+And+Times+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8e6ddda860ac969f9c49aae91f52e19884f6f44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,230,221,218,134,10,201,105,249,196,154,174,145,245,46,25,136,79,111,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
