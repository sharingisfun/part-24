English subtitles are embedded on screen.\n\nGoogle Chromecast still does not handle subtitles very well. This older movie rip may be necessary as a fix for Chromecast users. Unfortunately, none of the better quality Criterion Collection versions is currently compatible with Chromecast (03/14/2014) using external subtitle files. (If you find or create a Chromecast-compatible Criterion RIP of Solyaris with embedded English subtitles, please leave a comment.)\n\nIf you are looking for a sci-fi &quot;action&quot; film, look elsewhere. Solyaris is a &quot;thinking man's&quot; movie. For English speaking viewers, after watching 1972 Solyaris, I recommend watching the 2002 Solaris remake. The 1972 original will help in better understanding the 2002 film and vice versa.\n\nVideo: H264 ( 288 x 480 ) --- Audio: AAC (m4a) stereo 48000\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586c8f547950c167c478d9f8fe6166c67acd7881","amp;dn":"Solaris+1972+Solyaris+English+Hardsubs+for+Chromecast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586c8f547950c167c478d9f8fe6166c67acd7881","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,108,143,84,121,80,193,103,196,120,217,248,254,97,102,198,122,205,120,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
