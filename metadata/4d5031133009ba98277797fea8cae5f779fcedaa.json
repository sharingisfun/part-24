Unfortunately, like a lot of stand-up comedy, it relies too heavily on four-letter words, rapid-fire attack patter and, I would venture to guess, visual cues during the performance. The result is that a lot of the really funny and biting material is absent from the recording -- this would actually work a whole lot better on videotape, where the comedy can be projected by the performer. Harris works hard and puts across the ethnic impressions (mostly oriented to Chicago and New York) very well indeed, and he sounds great. Unfortunately, without the visual cues to go by, much of the comedy here falls flat.\n\n1 \tIntro/Down Home Blues \t\t\tHarris \t1:32\n2 \tFeeling Good \t\t\t\tHarris \t:28\n3 \t3 Big B...
