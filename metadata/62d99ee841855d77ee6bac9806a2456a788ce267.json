Sweezy-PTC\n\n\n\nSince its first publication in 1942, this book has become the classic analytical study of Marxist economics. Written by an economist who was a master of modern academic theory as well as Marxist literature, it has been recognized as the ideal textbook in its subject. Comprehensive, lucid, authoritative, it has not been challenged or even approached by any later study.\n\n\n\nPaul Marlor Sweezy (April 10, 1910 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ February 28, 2004) was a Marxian economist, political activist, publisher, and founding editor of the long-running magazine Monthly Review. He is best remembered for his contributions to economic theory as one of the leading Marxian economists of the second half of the 20th century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62d99ee841855d77ee6bac9806a2456a788ce267","amp;dn":"The+Theory+of+Capitalist+Development-Paul+M+Sweezy-PTC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62d99ee841855d77ee6bac9806a2456a788ce267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,217,158,232,65,133,93,119,238,107,172,152,6,162,69,106,120,140,226,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
