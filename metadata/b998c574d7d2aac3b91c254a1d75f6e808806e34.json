The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.\n\nThis is A Lot of work folks!\n\n                                       Monk's Music\n\nMonk's Music is a 1957 album by Thelonious Monk's jazz septet. It was recorded in New York on June 26, 1957. The first song &quot;Abide With Me&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a hymn by W. H. MonkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is an austere rendition played only by the septet's horn section. The song &quot;Ruby, My Dear&quot; is performed only by Monk, Coleman Hawkins, Wilbur Ware, and Art Blakey. John Coltrane had joined Monk after a spell with the Miles Davis Quintet, and this is Coltrane's only studio recording with Monk, who can be heard enthusiastically calling on him to take the first solo on the album in &quot;Well, You Needn't&quot; (though Coltrane's name does not appear on the front cover). All of the songs except one are original compositions by Thelonious Monk, but some had appeared on previous albums by Monk. The album was reissued by the Original Jazz Classics label on July 1, 1991.\n\nThe two mixes of this album (stereo and mono) are notable in that they used entirely different setups of microphones, recording the same performances. The stereo mix was recorded using mics at a greater distance from the band, and therefore has a distinctly different sound from the mono mix.\n[edit] Track listing\n\nOriginal recording : Side A :\n\n   1. &quot;Abide with Me&quot;\n   2. &quot;Well, You Needn't&quot;\n   3. &quot;Ruby, My Dear&quot;\n\nSide B :\n\n   1. &quot;Off Minor&quot;\n   2. &quot;Epistrophy&quot;\n   3. &quot;Crepuscule with Nellie&quot;\n\nCD reissue :\n\n   1. &quot;Abide with Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:52\n   2. &quot;Well, You Needn't&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:24\n   3. &quot;Ruby, My Dear&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:26\n   4. &quot;Off Minor (Take 5)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n   5. &quot;Off Minor (Take 4)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12\n   6. &quot;Epistrophy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:45\n   7. &quot;Crepuscule with Nellie (Take 6)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n   8. &quot;Crepuscule with Nellie (Take 4 and 5)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n\n[edit] Personnel\n\n    * Thelonious Monk - piano\n    * Ray Copeland - trumpet\n    * Gigi Gryce - alto saxophone\n    * Coleman Hawkins - tenor saxophone\n    * John Coltrane - tenor saxophone\n    * Wilbur Ware - double bass\n    * Art Blakey - drums\n\n    * Orrin Keepnews - Producer\n    * Jack Higgins - Recording engineer\n    * Kirk Felton - Digital remastering\n    * Paul Weller - Cover photo\n    * Paul Bacon - Cover design\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b998c574d7d2aac3b91c254a1d75f6e808806e34","amp;dn":"%7B24-96%7D+Thelonious+Monk+-+Monk%5C%27s+Music+-+FLAC+320+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b998c574d7d2aac3b91c254a1d75f6e808806e34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,152,197,116,215,210,170,195,185,28,37,74,29,117,246,232,8,128,110,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
