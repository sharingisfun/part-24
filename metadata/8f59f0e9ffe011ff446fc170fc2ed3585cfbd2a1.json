The programme ran for six series, initially airing in February 2000, and concluding in Sepetmber 2006. The series follows the antics of dim-witted superhero &quot;Thermoman&quot;, portrayed by Ardal O'Hanlon (who was replaced by James Dreyfus in the final series). The series was regularly directed by John Stroud. In the UK, digital channel G.O.L.D. regularly re-run the series, however, the last series has yet to air on the channel. In the United States, PBS are currently airing back-to-back episodes of the series. The series was also shown on BBC America for a short period, however, it has since been dropped from the schedule. In Australia, UKTV offer re-runs of the first three series, while BBC Entertainment provides repeats for Scandinavia. At present, three seasons of the programme have been released on DVD, with the third series being the first released in the United Kingdom.\n\nThermoman is a multiple-powered superhero who originates from the planet Ultron. In an attempt to do his best to fit in with life on earth, he creates the human alias of George Sunday. However, due to his unfamiliarity with human life, his antics usually lead to many misunderstandings. Although on the inside Thermoman is very intelligent, his problem understanding earthly customs makes him look like an idiot to people who don't know who he really is. At the start of the first series, he saves wife-to-be Janet Dawkins from danger, and after falling in love, the pair later conceive two children, Ollie and Cassie. Other main characters include Piers Crispin, a self obsessed doctor who has a crush on Janet; Mrs. Raven, the miserable doctor's receptionist; Ella and Stanley Dawkins, Janet's over-protective parents; and Arnie, Thermoman's cousin, a one-time superhero who runs a restaurant in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f59f0e9ffe011ff446fc170fc2ed3585cfbd2a1","amp;dn":"My+Hero+-+BBC+Comedy+Series+Complete+6+seasons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f59f0e9ffe011ff446fc170fc2ed3585cfbd2a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,89,240,233,255,224,17,255,68,111,193,112,252,46,211,88,92,251,210,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
