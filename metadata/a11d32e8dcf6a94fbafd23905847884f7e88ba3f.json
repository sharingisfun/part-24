But \n\t\t   the New Testament reveals little about this defining miracle of the Christian faith. Using tools of history, \n\t\t   technology, science and faith, HISTORY tells the little-known story. Long-buried non-Biblical sources, such as the \n\t\t   Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, the Secret Revelation of John and the writings of the Jewish historian \n\t\t   Josephus yield astonishing information and detail about these seemingly lost 40 days. Could Jesus' words in these \n\t\t   ancient manuscripts contain some of his most important teachings, even though they were not included in the New \n\t\t   Testament? The producers also build upon the CGI image of the crucified Christ created from the Shroud of Turin in The \n\t\t   Real Face of Jesus to visually depict the moments when Jesus appears to his followers in resurrected form.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a11d32e8dcf6a94fbafd23905847884f7e88ba3f","amp;dn":"History.Channel.Jesus.The.Lost.40.Days.HDTV.XviD-DiVERGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a11d32e8dcf6a94fbafd23905847884f7e88ba3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,29,50,232,220,246,169,79,186,253,35,144,88,71,136,79,126,136,186,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
