Pete Judge (trumpet, harmonium, lyre, glockenspiel) plays trumpet for the equally highly-regarded Get The Blessing (BBC Jazz Award-winners) and for the duo Eyebrow. Paul Bradley (acoustic guitar) is the maverick genius behind legendary Bristol band Organelles, and has his own one-man music-and-storytelling show, The Owl. Alex and Pete have also worked together previously as musician-performers with Kneehigh, the acclaimed Cornish theatre company.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n\nThree Cane Whale's eponymous debut album was recorded live (by Spiro's Jon Hunt) in an eleven hour shift in an eighteenth-century Bristol church last summer. Distant snippets of birdsong occasionally spill into the mix, which also celebrates the eccentric creakings and clickings of the trio's unusual instrumentation. The music encompasses both a cinematic sweep and an intimate delicacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d894a563fc7d4abab919a52881eb3c5444489c4c","amp;dn":"Three+Cane+Whale...Three+Cane+Whale%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d894a563fc7d4abab919a52881eb3c5444489c4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,148,165,99,252,125,74,186,185,25,165,40,129,235,60,84,68,72,156,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
