First you have to download them, after which you can install or delete them, open their file location, hide items or report errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the &quot;Tools&quot; menu, you can view hardware information, use a backup and restore system for the drivers, as well as uninstall them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you can select the Interface language, configure proxy settings, set DriverEasy to automatically create a restore point before installing the drivers and view a list of all hidden devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program consumes a moderate-to-high amound of system resources and doesn't include a help file. Overall, it works smoothly, but sometimes it can take a very long while to download a driver. DriverEasy even freezes during downloading tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some cases, I'm weren't able to install the download items. Also, the demo version allows you to download only one driver at a time. So, I suggest you test DriverEasy for yourself!\r\n\r\n\r\nDriverEasy 4.9.6.35549 â€“ Release Date: 2015.10.29 (Current Version):\r\n\r\n* 3rd improve Windows 10 driver detection.\r\n- Fix â€œVersion string is too long or too shortâ€ problem","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:578af7e2a9c860258fa78675d6e4cb3f04847f54","amp;dn":"DriverEasy+Professional+4.9.7.2779+%2B+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"578af7e2a9c860258fa78675d6e4cb3f04847f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,138,247,226,169,200,96,37,143,167,134,117,214,228,203,63,4,132,127,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
