Her soul transferred to another plane, and returned to Earth in the modern world. She is strongly concerned with environmental issues. Mystic has long white hair down to her ankles, wears a set of golden spirals in her hair which resemble the insect-antenna of faeries, and her costume is basically a black spandex catsuit created with Zip-A-Tone.\n\nMs. Mystic is a magician; her ability to wield magic also gives her the power of flight, the ability to summon a sword of light, and undefined &quot;Elemental powers.&quot;\n\nShe can also call upon Mother Nature for assistance. Ms. Mystic once called upon Mother Nature for help, and she responded by creating the superhero team Urth 4. Urth 4 are strongly influenced by the Fantastic Four: a group of four superheroes based on the four classical Greek elements.\n\nThanks goes to jhulk1, Jaklar, Potifar, Mr. Woodman, and the other scanners for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af29f2f5024e60cfc19bfad2bc7dc561f10fce3d","amp;dn":"Ms.+Mystic+%281987-1994%29+%28fixed%29+%28Continuity+Comics%29+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af29f2f5024e60cfc19bfad2bc7dc561f10fce3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,41,242,245,2,78,96,207,193,155,250,210,188,125,197,97,241,15,206,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
