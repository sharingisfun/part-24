To further his examination of each type of conflict, Earl Conteh-Morgan presents case studies, from the Rwandan genocide to the United States civil rights movement. Along the way, he illuminates new debates concerning terrorism, peacekeeping, and environmental security.\nWritten in a knowledgeable, yet accessible, manner, Collective Political Violence treats the issue of political violence with an impressively wide geographic range, and successfully straddles the ideological divide.\n\n# Paperback: 368 pages\n# Publisher: Routledge (November 2, 2003)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0415947448\n# ISBN-13: 978-0415947442","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d1911b20a83b4deed40cebec013c7bdcc0ec1ca","amp;dn":"Collective+Political+Violence+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d1911b20a83b4deed40cebec013c7bdcc0ec1ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,25,17,178,10,131,180,222,237,64,206,190,192,19,199,189,204,14,193,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
