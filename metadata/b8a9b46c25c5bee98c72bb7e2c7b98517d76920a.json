Now, since Tha Carter V has been similarly pushed back thanks to an ongoing battle between Wayne and Birdman, he's delivered Sorry 4 the Wait 2.\nIt features 2 Chainz, Drake, Christina Milian, and more. It's got Wayne's remixes of BeyoncÃƒÂ©'s &quot;Drunk in Love, iLoveMakonnen's &quot;Maneuvering&quot;, Future's &quot;Sh!t&quot;, Bobby Shmurda's &quot;Hot Nigga&quot;, Dej Loaf's &quot;Try Me&quot;, Rae Sremmurd's &quot;No Type&quot;, and more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8a9b46c25c5bee98c72bb7e2c7b98517d76920a","amp;dn":"Lil+Wayne+-+Sorry+4+the+Wait+2+%5B2015%5D+%5BMixtape%5D+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8a9b46c25c5bee98c72bb7e2c7b98517d76920a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,169,180,108,37,197,190,233,140,114,187,126,44,123,152,81,125,118,146,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
