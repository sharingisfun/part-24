He needs to start\nto make an income if his childhood sweetheart, now his wife, is\nto get her way and start a family. This will be his last try before\nhe'll have to get a day job.\n\nAfter a dramatic image change, his self-produced solo show catches\nthe attention of Edinburgh producer Karen Koren, wins him the\nsurprise Director's Choice award and an offer of a coveted spot at\nthe Edinburgh Arts Festival. He takes it. Our camera goes with him.\n\nEven for the big league players Edinburgh is the most competitive\ncomedy festival in the world. Tim was a complete unknown. He was\ndeliciously na ve. He was a hit.\n\nAfter the most successful first season of any performer in the\nhistory of Edinburgh Tim walks away with the prestigious Perrier\nNewcomer Award, TV appearances, offers from Hollywood and the West\nEnd, the best management in the business and a gig at Albert Hall.\nNow everyone wants a piece of him.\n\nHe arrives home to Melbourne a hero with all the pressures of the\n&quot;second album syndrome&quot; to contend with as he writes his next show.\nCan he live up to the hype?\n\nIt's not long before he's saying good-bye to the safety and comfort\nof Melbourne for London to find out if the UK industry buzz is hot\nair or the sure beginnings of a long career. Will his talent be enough?\nWill his wife get the family she so desperately wants? Can the marriage\nsurvive the maelstrom of new pressures? Can the rise continue?\n\nFor the first time in his life he has somewhere to fall.\n\nFilmed over 3 tumultuous years by a close friend Rock n Roll Nerd is an\nintimate tale of love and ambition and a rare record of the very first\nsteps in a brilliant career.
