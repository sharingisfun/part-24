In the AFC Championship game, to the surprise and dismay of virtually everyone, Rick actually got into the game. With a 17-point lead and just minutes to go, Rick provided what was arguably the worst single performance in the history of the NFL. Overnight, he became a national laughingstockÃ¢â‚¬â€and was immediately cut by the Browns and shunned by all other teams. But all Rick knows is football, and he insists that his agent find a team that needs him. Against enormous odds, Rick finally gets a jobÃ¢â‚¬â€as the starting quarterback for the Mighty Panthers . . . of Parma, Italy. The Parma Panthers desperately want a former NFL playerÃ¢â‚¬â€any former NFL playerÃ¢â‚¬â€at their helm. And now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got Rick, who knows nothing about Parma (not even where it is) and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t speak a word of Italian. To say that ItalyÃ¢â‚¬â€the land of fine wines, extremely small cars, and football americanoÃ¢â‚¬â€holds a few surprises for Rick Dockery would be something of an understatement. \n\n\nghost dog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fde9696371012f37fee137a2211493a240309762","amp;dn":"Playing+For+Pizza+by+John+Grisham+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fde9696371012f37fee137a2211493a240309762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,233,105,99,113,1,47,55,254,225,55,162,33,20,147,162,64,48,151,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
