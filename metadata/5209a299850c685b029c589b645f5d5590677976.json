The singer/songwriter recently explained to Uncut that her marriage in 2013 had invited death into her life, â€œbecause there is someone you canâ€™t bear to lose,â€ she said. â€œWhen it registers as true, itâ€™s like a little shade of grief comes in when love is its most real version. Then it contains death inside of it, and then that death contains love inside of it.â€ There is only one domestic vignette on the record, towards the end of â€œLeaving the Cityâ€, where Newsom and her love go running on a beautiful day. Immediately, though, her high dims: â€œThe spirit bends beneath knowing it must end.â€ 2010â€™s Have One on Me traced the death of a relationship as Newsom tried and failed to defeat a proud manâ€™s human nature. On Divers, she attempts to defeat time to stave off death. To bear the weight of its subject, Divers fits to scale, ornate and roaming after the intimacies of Have One on Me. The arrangementsâ€”tackled by Newsom along with eight different musicians, including Nico Muhly, Ryan Francesconi, Dirty Projectorsâ€™ David Longstreth, and her brother Peteâ€”cover the ground of all her past work in a fraction of the time, making this her most dynamic and exhilarating album. The first half in particular veers between baroque poise, jaunty blues, and rococo beauty, as if searching for answers in disparate places. Landlocked between the dry, acoustic arrangements of â€œThe Things I Sayâ€ and â€œSame Old Manâ€, the lilting harp and piano of the title track casts her lover as a deep sea diver and measures the distance between them, â€œhow the infinite divides.â€ The meticulous internal rhymes in the chorus of â€œLeaving the Cityâ€ contract against the tug of her harp, a cascade of tiny parts that form a huge, billowing whole, like tiny bones in a vast wingspan. â€œThe longer you live, the higher the rent,â€ she sings inside the frenzy.\r\n\r\nDivers makes a landscape out of this abstract fear of loss. On the courtly â€œAnecdotesâ€ and â€œWaltz of the 101st Lightborneâ€, she is part of a battle fought by birds to try and wrest control of time. â€œYou Will Not Take My Heart Aliveâ€ is the most Ren Fair piece here, on which Newsom contemplates ascension to some transcendent plane, â€œ[severing] all strings to everyone and everything.â€ Its sister song â€œA Pin-Light Bentâ€ descends sadly back towards reason and reconciliation of her unsuccessful quest to outrun time. â€œIn our lives is a common sense/ That relies on the common fence/ That divides and attends,â€ she sings with palpable mourning, accepting that her life, â€œuntil the time is spent, is a pin-light, bent.â€ Where this kind of cosmic existentialism could come off like a stoner marveling at the moon, Newsom pulls it off with balance of poetry and reason. Her fantastical world is sometimes hard to get your head around, but it brings surreal, sometimes sci-fi delight to a record thatâ€™s otherwise often lyrically despairing.\r\n\r\nWhere Newsomâ€™s second and third records each overhauled what came before, Divers is a refinement that draws on elements of each of its predecessors. The shapes of her records often get misinterpreted as concepts themselves, rather than the sign of a writer attuned to her workâ€™s needs. Ys from 2006 was the five-song suite; Have One on Me from 2010, the three-disc opus. On its surface Divers is more conventional, a single disc where nine of its 11 songs are under six minutes long, but it also happens to be a wild, genuine concept album. The final song, â€œTime, As a Symptomâ€, ends with Newsom in raptures, commanding white stars, birds, and ships to â€œtranscend!â€ On the very last burst, she clips the word to â€œtransâ€”â€. The first word on opener â€œAnecdotesâ€ is â€œsending.â€ It is a perfect loop.\r\n\r\nMost artists on their fourth album settle into atrophy, or at least comfort, Newsom delivers such complex, nuanced music, filled with arcane constructions, that she is only her own yardstick. (In a recent interview about Divers, David Longstreth cited The Milk-Eyed Mender as one of the reasons he quit college: â€œ[What] am I doing here if someone is already out there making music like this, on this level?â€) Her consummate craft is a given; what surprises every time is her ceaselessly renewing sensitivity for lifeâ€™s vicissitudes and the fantastic ways she finds to express them. Divers is not a puzzle to crack, but a dialog that generously articulates the intimate chasm of loss, the way itâ€™s both irrational and very real. Nothing will stem the fear of a loved oneâ€™s death, which western culture does little to prepare us for until the very end, but by pulling at the prospect of mortality from every angle, Newsom emerges straighter-spined, and invites you to stand alongside her.\r\nRating\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01 - Joanna Newsom - Anecdotes.flac\r\n02 - Joanna Newsom - Sapokanikan.flac\r\n03 - Joanna Newsom - Leaving The City.flac\r\n04 - Joanna Newsom - Goose Eggs.flac\r\n05 - Joanna Newsom - Waltz Of The 101st Lightborne.flac\r\n06 - Joanna Newsom - The Things I Say.flac\r\n07 - Joanna Newsom - Divers.flac\r\n08 - Joanna Newsom - Same Old Man.flac\r\n09 - Joanna Newsom - You Will Not Take My Heart Alive.flac\r\n10 - Joanna Newsom - A Pin-Light Bent.flac\r\n11 - Joanna Newsom - Time, As A Symptom.flac\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: USA\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~628-763 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5209a299850c685b029c589b645f5d5590677976","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Joanna+Newsom+-+Divers+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5209a299850c685b029c589b645f5d5590677976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,9,162,153,133,12,104,91,2,156,88,155,100,95,93,85,144,103,121,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
