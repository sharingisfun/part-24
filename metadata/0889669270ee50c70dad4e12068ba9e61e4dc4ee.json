But as MIT physicist and historian David Kaiser reveals, this cutting-edge field has a surprisingly psychedelic past. How the Hippies Saved Physics introduces us to a band of freewheeling physicists who defied the imperative to Ã¢â‚¬Å“shut up and calculateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and helped to rejuvenate modern physics.\n\nIn the 1970s, amid severe cutbacks in physics funding, a small group of underemployed physicists in Berkeley decided to throw off the constraints of academia and explore the wilder side of science. Dubbing themselves the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fundamental Fysiks Group,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they pursued an unconventional, speculative approach to physics. They studied quantum theory alongside Eastern mysticism and psychic mind-reading, discussing the latest developments while lounging in hot tubs. Unlikely as it may seem, their work on BellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theorem and quantum entanglement helped pave the way for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breakthroughs in quantum information science.\n\nHow the Hippies Saved Physics is published by W.
