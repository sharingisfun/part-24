You'll find no annoying songs, or silly sound effects. iRingPro iPhone ringtone collections consist of smart, attractive, livable alerts engineered to ensure universal appeal, and a high tolerance for routine use and repetition. You might even call them &quot;grown up&quot;.\n\nNow every iRingPro iPhone ringtone provides the option of longer pauses between ring repeats. So there is no hurried fumbling, no urgency. You have time to see who's calling before the second ring. \n\nRinger Grades\n\nEach iRingPro iPhone ringtone collection gives you the ability to fine tune your iPhone's report. All our ringtones fall into one of two grades:\n\nMeeting Grade\n\nThe tonal quality of iRingPro's Meeting Grade iPhone ringtones are subtler, lower pitched, and richer. These ringtones were designed specifically for quiet or professional settings. Though alertive, conversation can continue undisturbed. These can be identified by the file tag &quot;MG&quot;\n\nActive Grade\n\nOur Active Grade iPhone ringtones are stronger, more resonant, and present. They have been engineered to maximize your iPhone's &quot;small-speaker&quot; technology, and will be more audible in cars, social and outdoor settings. These can be identified by the file tag &quot;AG&quot;\n\nWith iRingPro iPhone Ringtones, now you can set your Alarm Clocks and Timers to gently alert you. \n\nYou'll find access to all your iRingPro ringtones from within the associated control panels on your iPhone. Whether in bed, or at your desk, startling awake is now a thing of the past.\n\n--&gt;&gt; PLEASE SEED &lt;&lt;--\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f4d525d73156c6ea9b2f38812a04942118e387f","amp;dn":"iRingPro+Zen2%2C+Origin%2C+and+Tek+Ringtones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f4d525d73156c6ea9b2f38812a04942118e387f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,77,82,93,115,21,108,110,169,178,243,136,18,160,73,66,17,142,56,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
