The topic of debate that evening\nwas the infamous phrase from Barry Goldwater's 1964 Republican\nConvention speech: &quot;Extremism in the defense of liberty is no\nvice; moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.&quot; At a\ntime when Malcolm was traveling widely and advocating on behalf\nof blacks in America and other nations, his thirty minute\nspeech at the Oxford Union stands out as one of the great\naddresses of the civil rights era. Delivered just months before\nhis assassination, the speech followed a period in which Malcolm\nhad traveled throughout Africa and much of the Muslim world.\nThe journey broadened his political thought to encompass\ndecolonization, the revolutions underway in the developing\nworld, and the relationship between American blacks and\nnon-white populations across the globe-including England.\n\nMalcolm X at Oxford Union: Racial Politics in\na Global Era (Transgressing Boundaries: Studies\nin Black Politics and Black Communities)\nby Saladin Ambar\nPages: 446\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage:EN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb4713fe81edd17a00fe0980d98987bceef45ef9","amp;dn":"Malcolm+X+at+Oxford+Union+Racial+Politics+in+a+Global+Era+by+Sal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb4713fe81edd17a00fe0980d98987bceef45ef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,71,19,254,129,237,209,122,0,254,9,128,217,137,135,188,238,244,94,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
