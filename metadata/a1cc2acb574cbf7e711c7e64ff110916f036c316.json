He decides to live a relatively low-key life after retirement, and he only communicates with two people on a regular basis after retiring: his &quot;handler&quot; Sally and his niece in England. His world is rocked back into action, however, as new CIA director Michael Beesley has decided that Paul needs to be put down after the atrocities of orders he was told to go through with. A strike team is sent to Paul's home with orders to terminate him, but Paul winds up taking out all three of the agents and recognizes their tactics. A phone call later, Paul confirms to the CIA that he is taking himself off &quot;Green&quot; status and going &quot;Red&quot;, vowing to kill both Director Beesley as well as Deputy Director Adrian Kane for disturbing his peace","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1cc2acb574cbf7e711c7e64ff110916f036c316","amp;dn":"Red+%2801+-+03%29+%282003%29+%28HGWells-OCD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1cc2acb574cbf7e711c7e64ff110916f036c316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,204,42,203,87,76,191,126,113,28,126,100,255,17,9,22,240,54,195,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
