Iran has nukes. IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leader is hospitalized. History is now up to 35 Israelis. Ethnically diverse. Ideologically divided. On a nuclear-armed submarine. \n________________________________ \n\nMORE DETAILS: \n\nIn this gripping doomsday thriller &quot;ripped from the headlines,&quot; Iran has threatened to destroy Israel while developing the nuclear capability to do so. \n\nStruck by a medical emergency, IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Prime Minister falls unconscious just as military action is needed to stop IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nukes. \n\nHistory is now up to 35 Israelis aboard the Dolphin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a powerful submarine armed with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. \n\nShip unity is crucial to mission success, but deep conflicts rise to the surface among crewmembers who are ethnically diverse and ideologically divided. \n\nTensions boil further from the rivalry between the captain and his deputy, and a childhood tragedy that quietly haunts a younger sailor whose psychological wounds could explode at any time. \n\nThus, in addition to the naval action and plot twists found in military thrillers and war fiction, character study and psychological suspense also feature prominently in the novel. \n\nOn their suspenseful voyage to Armageddon, the submariners must confront each other -- and pulse-pounding threats at sea -- before facing an unthinkable dilemma. \n\nIt will be the toughest decision of their lives Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and it will determine the fate of the Middle East. \n____ \n\nGENRES: apocalyptic fiction, apocalyptic novel, apocalyptic thriller, nuclear thriller, submarine thriller, submarine fiction, submarine stories, submarine warfare, naval thriller, psychological thriller, geopolitical thriller, military thriller, war fiction, war thriller, Armageddon fiction, Armageddon novel, doomsday fiction, doomsday novel, Israel fiction\n\n ISBN: 1482774372\nWritten by Noah Beck \nRead by Jeffrey Buckner Ford \nFormat: MP3 \n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
