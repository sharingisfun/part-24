That, and the picture was distorted on the MP4. Thank you for the source material, though. It was nice to work with, and to maintain quality :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a4778a3f382b2a6e706f7a0753bcd6156c190ad","amp;dn":"The+Cure+-+Show+%5BXviD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a4778a3f382b2a6e706f7a0753bcd6156c190ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,71,120,163,243,130,178,166,231,6,247,160,117,59,205,97,86,193,144,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
