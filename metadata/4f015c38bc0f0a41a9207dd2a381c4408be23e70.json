I zipped the Bootcamp folder straight from the CD, and this comes with the 3.1 update for either 32 or 64 bit. Choose the one you want to download and have a go at it! This is my first torrent, so leave a comment if you need help or have a question!\n\nThanks and Enjoy\n\nPlease Leave comment and give good rating (if it works of course). \n\nI'm uploading as fast as I can until 15 or so people get it (20 Mbps), or for a few days, after which I'll still upload, just not nearly as fast. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f015c38bc0f0a41a9207dd2a381c4408be23e70","amp;dn":"Bootcamp+3.0+and+3.1+update+for+32+and+64+.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f015c38bc0f0a41a9207dd2a381c4408be23e70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,1,92,56,188,15,10,65,169,32,125,210,163,129,196,64,139,226,62,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
