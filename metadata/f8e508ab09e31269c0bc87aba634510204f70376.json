He is also eccentric, reclusive, confined to a wheelchair, and looking for a way to die. Nate O'Riley is a high-octane Washington litigator who's lived too hard, too fast, for too long. Emerging from his fourth stay in rehab he knows returning to the real world is always difficult, but this time it's going to be murder. Rachel Lane is a young woman who chose to give her life to God, who walked away from the modern world with all its strivings and trappings and encumbrances, and went to live and work with a primitive tribe of Indians in the deepest jungles of Brazil. In a story that mixes legal suspense with a remarkable adventure, their lives are forever altered by the startling secret of THE TESTAMENT.\nFiles:.pdf(Adobe Reader)\n.txt(Text Document)\n.lit(Microsoft EBook Document)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8e508ab09e31269c0bc87aba634510204f70376","amp;dn":"The+Testament%281999%29John+Grisham%5BVectoR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8e508ab09e31269c0bc87aba634510204f70376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,229,8,171,9,227,18,105,192,188,135,171,166,52,81,2,4,247,3,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
