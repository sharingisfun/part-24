M, Human Target as MP4 H264; ~3.48 MB/minute\nFriday:  30 R, Grey's A., Supernatural, Fringe as MP4 H264; ~3.30 MB/minute \nSaturday:  Smallville, Caprica, Dollhouse as MP4 H264; ~3.30 MB/minute\nSunday:  Legend o.t.S. as MP4 H264; ~3.30 MB/minute, re-seed of week's episodes\nMonday:  Desp.H, Being Human as MP4 H264; ~3.30 MB/minute\nDouble-episodes, requests or Pilot ep. will be issued only as MP4 or 360p.\nMP4 is ISO 14496-1(H264 video &amp; AAC LC sound) and playable on PCs, Macs and hopefully (read Comment before download; I check every file for iTunes compliance) on iPod-like portable-mobile devices.Due to small frame-size recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768.\n360p is fully compatible with newer iPod, iTouch and Nokia U97. \nRequests should be posted in Comments section of newest torrents.\n&quot;Out of schedule&quot; shows or pilot-episodes may get uploaded randomly, if situation arise (free slots).\n\nI recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nWARNING: \n\nIf you limit your upload speed during the download FOR WHATEVER REASON, you'll be kicked-out for good. I am sick and tired not only of Hit&amp;Run, but of 90% who think I'm some kind of &quot;free launch&quot; downloading service. NO - IT'S ABOUT SHARING. If you do not want or can or care to share, please, go someplace else. Consider this as one friendly warning. \n\nNOTE:\n\nI have no idea why Groups have missed this episode, and I have no clue is this one ep.12 or not, I guess it is. I don't watch nor follow with schedule &quot;Leverage&quot; and for sure I never will. I just have read some complaining about (&quot;where is &quot;Leverage 212&quot; on some forum); I have found one and re-encode it. So, take it or leave itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. Or wait for &quot;official&quot; release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65f8cdd6243ed4e2dd15658821f7537e3a33123b","amp;dn":"Leverage.S02E12.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65f8cdd6243ed4e2dd15658821f7537e3a33123b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,248,205,214,36,62,212,226,221,21,101,136,33,247,83,126,58,51,18,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
