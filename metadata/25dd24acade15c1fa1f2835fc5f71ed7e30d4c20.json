Printed in U.S.A. \n\nAllmusic.com\n\nReview by Paul Collins \n\nIn a debut consisting of covers, nobody could accuse Vanilla Fudge of bad taste in \ntheir repertoire; with stoned-out, slowed-down versions of such then-recent \nclassics as &quot;Ticket to Ride,&quot; &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; and &quot;People Get Ready,&quot; they were \nsetting the bar rather high for themselves. Even the one suspect choice -- Sonny \nBono's &quot;Bang Bang&quot; -- turns out to be rivaled only by Mott the Hoople's version of \n&quot;Laugh at Me&quot; in putting Bono's songwriting in the kindest possible light. Most of \nthe tracks here share a common structure of a disjointed warm-up jam, a Hammond-\nheavy dirge of harmonized vocals at the center, and a final flat-out jam. Still, \nsome succeed better than others: &quot;You Keep Me Hanging On&quot; has a wonderfully \nhammered-out drum part, and &quot;She's Not There&quot; boasts some truly groovy organ jams. \nWhile the pattern can sound repetitive today, each song still works as a time \ncapsule of American psychedelia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25dd24acade15c1fa1f2835fc5f71ed7e30d4c20","amp;dn":"1967-+Vanilla+Fudge+-+Vanilla+Fudge+Vinylrip+24bit-96khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25dd24acade15c1fa1f2835fc5f71ed7e30d4c20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,221,36,172,173,225,92,31,161,242,131,95,197,247,30,215,227,13,76,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
