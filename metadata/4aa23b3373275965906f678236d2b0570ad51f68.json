On Richard's first night there, in a low-budget guest house, a fellow traveler slashes his wrists, bequeathing to Richard a meticulously drawn map to &quot;the Beach.&quot;\n\nThe Beach, as Richard has come to learn, is the subject of a legend among young travelers in Asia: a lagoon hidden from the sea, with white sand and coral gardens, freshwater falls surrounded by jungle, plants untouched for a thousand years. There, it is rumored, a carefully selected international few have settled in a communal Eden.\n\nHaunted by the figure of Mr. Duck--the name by which the Thai police have identified the dead man--and his own obsession with Vietnam movies, Richard sets off with a young French couple to an island hidden away in an archipelago forbidden to tourists. They discover the Beach, and it is as beautiful and idyllic as it is reputed to be. Yet over time it becomes clear that Beach culture, as Richard calls it, has troubling, even deadly, undercurrents.\n\nSpellbinding and hallucinogenic, The Beach is a look at a generation in their twenties, who, burdened with the legacy of the preceding generation and saturated by popular culture, long for an unruined landscape, but find it difficult to experience the world firsthand. \n\nhtml, use calibre to convert to format of your choice: http://calibre-ebook.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aa23b3373275965906f678236d2b0570ad51f68","amp;dn":"Alex+Garland+-+The+Beach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aa23b3373275965906f678236d2b0570ad51f68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,162,59,51,115,39,89,101,144,111,103,130,54,210,176,87,10,213,31,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
