She is caught, and sentenced by Creon to be buried alive - even though she is betrothed to his son Haemon. After the blind prophet Tiresias proves that the gods are on Antigone&amp;#039;s side, Creon changes his mind - but too late. He goes first to bury Polynices, but Antigone has already hanged herself. When Creon arrives at the tomb, Haemon attacks him and then kills himself. When the news of their death is reported, Creon&amp;#039;s wife Eurydice takes her own life. Creon is alone. \n\nARIS RETSOS\nHe was born in Alexandria, Egypt and studied acting at the Veaki School in Athens. In 1980 he became widely known in Greece through his role in the TV series Astrofengia. He went on to work in film with filmmakers such as George Panoussopoulos, Nikos Koundouros and Nico Papatakis. In recent years he has turned to Ancient Drama, offering innovative readings of ancient Greek texts which he has performed both in Greece and abroad.\n\nRelated links:\nh**p://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigone_(Sophocles)\nh**p://classics.mit.edu/Sophocles/antigone.html\nh**p://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/bates017.html\n\nTechnical Characteristics:\nEncoder:  LAME v3.97\nSettings:  -V 3 --vbr-new\nEstimated bitrate:  177 kbps (VBR)\nStereo Mode:  Stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95d6320377e4ca2c49c406c1f8e6e3d4151c03bb","amp;dn":"Aris+Retsos+-+Sophocles%5C%27+Antigone+%5Bgreek+ancient+tragedy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95d6320377e4ca2c49c406c1f8e6e3d4151c03bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,214,50,3,119,228,202,44,73,196,6,193,248,230,227,212,21,28,3,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
