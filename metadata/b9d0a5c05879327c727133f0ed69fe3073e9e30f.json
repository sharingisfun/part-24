Determined to carve her own path in life, Merida defies an age-old custom sacred to the uproarious lords of the land: massive Lord MacGuffin (Kevin McKidd), surly Lord Macintosh (Craig Ferguson) and cantankerous Lord Dingwall (Robbie Coltrane). MeridaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions inadvertently unleash chaos and fury in the kingdom, and when she turns to an eccentric old Witch (Julie Walters) for help, she is granted an ill-fated wish. The ensuing peril forces Merida to discover the meaning of true bravery in order to undo a beastly curse before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late. \n\nGenre: Animation | Action | Adventure \nIMDB rating: 7.7/10 from 21,247 users \nDirected by: Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman \nStarring: Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson \n\nRelease Name: Brave.2012.TS.XViD.AC3.SeeN-CM8 \nSize: 928 MB \nVideo: XviD | 720Ãƒâ€”320 | 1 533 kbps \nAudio: English | AC3 | 128 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9d0a5c05879327c727133f0ed69fe3073e9e30f","amp;dn":"Brave.2012.TS.XViD.AC3.SeeN-CM8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9d0a5c05879327c727133f0ed69fe3073e9e30f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,208,165,192,88,121,50,124,114,113,51,240,237,105,254,48,115,233,227,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
