Now visible was a bewildering display of coloured devices on uniforms, helmets, vehicles, guns, signboards and flags. Regimental badges remained but were joined by divisional insignia.

In this beautifully illustrated book Mike Chappell looks at the colourful variety of insignia used by the British Army during the Great War","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:836c2124988a53a520e316e0b7e3414357d5f78a","amp;dn":"British+Battle+Insignia+%281%29+%3A+1914-18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"836c2124988a53a520e316e0b7e3414357d5f78a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,108,33,36,152,138,83,165,32,227,22,224,183,227,65,67,87,213,247,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
