We notice Bill OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Reilly is trying to take credit for the Jesse Ventura story Chris Kyle told on our show. We listen to Alex Jones as he claimed that the story was false and that we scripted it. Jim and Roland went to see Van Halen reunite at a small club last night. Opie and Sam bet on whether or not Opie went to a movie premiere and Sam loses his bedroom TV because of it. We analyze Sam and his cheapness/OCD and get his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Jess on the phone. Chip describes his new party game, Wardsback. We listen to 911 audio of a person asking permission to kill and intruder. David Duchovny stops in to talk about the new season of Californication. Sam hosts After Opie &amp; Anthony Live, where he talks to Tom Papa and tries to find out from Roland why Tom Papa didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get to do the regular show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36d4b318dbfac5958cf7e65658e6ae389d201d22","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony-01-06-2012%2BShit+Hour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36d4b318dbfac5958cf7e65658e6ae389d201d22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,212,179,24,219,250,197,149,140,247,230,86,88,230,174,56,157,32,29,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
