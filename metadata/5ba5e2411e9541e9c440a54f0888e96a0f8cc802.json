It was forked from OpenOffice.org in 2010, which was an open-sourced version of the earlier StarOffice. The LibreOffice suite comprises programs for word processing, the creation and editing of spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams and drawings, working with databases, and composing mathematical formulae. It is available in 110 languages.[7]\r\n\r\nLibreOffice uses the international ISO/IEC standard OpenDocument file format (ODF) as its native format to save documents for all of its applications. LibreOffice also supports the file formats of most other major office suites, including Microsoft Office, through a variety of import/export filters.[10][11]\r\n\r\nLibreOffice is available for a variety of computing platforms,[5] including Microsoft Windows, OS X (10.8 or newer), and Linux (including a LibreOffice Viewer for Android[12]). It is the default office suite of most popular Linux distributions.[13][14][15][16]\r\n\r\nBetween January 2011 (the first stable release) and October 2011, LibreOffice was downloaded approximately 7.5 million times.[17] The project claims 120 million unique downloading addresses from May 2011 to May 2015, excluding Linux distributions, with 55 million of those being from May 2014 to May 2015.[18]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ba5e2411e9541e9c440a54f0888e96a0f8cc802","amp;dn":"LibreOffice_5.2.1_Linux_x86-64_rpm.tar.gz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ba5e2411e9541e9c440a54f0888e96a0f8cc802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,165,226,65,30,149,65,233,196,64,165,79,8,136,233,106,15,140,200,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
