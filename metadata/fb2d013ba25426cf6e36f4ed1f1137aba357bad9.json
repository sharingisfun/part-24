As reflected in the track choices here, hillbilly boogie is in its full maturity, and the serious roots of hard honky tonk music are entering the jukebox and radio eras. There are some killer holdovers from the prime of Western swing, such as Moon Mullican and Bob Wills (whose classic Faded Love is included). But more the norm are performers like Hank Penny (with Bloodshot Eyes), Little Jimmy Dickens (Hillbilly Fever), Lefty Frizzell (If You've Got the Money, I've Got the Time) , Ernest Tubb (Letters Have No Arms), Jimmie Skinner(You Don't Know My Mind), Carl Smith (I Overlooked an Orchid While Looking for a Rose), Hank Williams (Long Gone Lonesome Blues), and Webb Pierce. The latter's killer Drifting Texas Sand is one of the real high points here. Floyd Tillman's I've Got the Craziest Feeling, and Red Foley's Sugarfoot Rag also lend to the overall wealth of this collection. But the true stellar moment is one of the earliest rock &amp; roll tunes in Hardrock Gunter's Birmingham Bounce,(complete with a wah-wah sounding steel guitar!) that kicks the pants off Bill Haley's Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll, and predates Chuck Berry by a few years - though to be fair, this sounds like a hillbilly version of the music played by Louis Jordan. In any case, this final volume is a fitting send-off to one of the most successfully curated of the bunch. \n(Thom Jurek)\n\n- - -\n\nVA - Dim Lights, Thick Smoke And Hillbilly Music 1950\n(Bear Family Records 2008)\n\n\n     1.
