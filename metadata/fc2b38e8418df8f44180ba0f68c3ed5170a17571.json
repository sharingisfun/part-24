Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) was the best swimmer of his graduating class, but upon surfacing as the sole survivor of an Alaskan rescue mission attempted during a Category Three storm, his outlook on life has grown increasingly jaded. Now, as hotshot young swimmer Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) arrives at Coast Guard rescue school looking to accomplish something meaningful with his life, he will be forced to endure the rigorous training methods of a man who expects nothing less than the very best in order to become a member of one of the most elite rescue squads on the planet.\n\nCast: Kevin Costner (Ben Randall), Ashton Kutcher (Jake Fischer), Sela Ward (Helen Randall), Melissa Sagemiller (Emily Thomas), Clancy Brown (Capt.
