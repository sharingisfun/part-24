Certain types of this tiny worm alter a hostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s DNA by injecting a virus which mutates the reproductive system. This forces the host to bear the wormÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s young. Typically these worms are never longer than a few millimeters. But guess what? Now thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a subspecies thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thirty feet long...\n\nWhen Nora and her team arrive at the island, she expects a routine zoological excursion...but it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take her long to realize theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not alone. Are her lurid sexual dreams making her paranoid...or is she being watched? The dead bodies they find are bad enough, but then her own team members begin to disappear, and when they return, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve...changed. Indeed, there are other people on the island...along with something else far worse.
