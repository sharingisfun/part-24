Mark Knopfler decided that a female voice would be more appropriate and handed the song to Tina Turner for her comeback album of the same name.\n\n&quot;The Way It Always Starts&quot;, another song written during the &quot;Love over Gold&quot; sessions, ended up on Knopfler's soundtrack to &quot;Local Hero&quot; with vocals sung by Gerry Rafferty.\n\n&quot;Badges, Posters, Stickers and T-Shirts&quot; was cut from the album, released in the UK as a B-side, and subsequently released in the U.S. as the 4th track on the ExtendedancEPlay EP.\n\n 1990 Tracklisting\nAll songs written by Mark Knopfler.\n\n&quot;Telegraph Road&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 14:15 \n&quot;Private Investigations&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:45 \n&quot;Industrial Disease&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:49 \n&quot;Love over Gold&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:16 \n&quot;It Never Rains&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:54 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77f7c9f142b4f2ed5f5fd07830df045a4acdbf5c","amp;dn":"Dire+Straits...Love+Over+Gold%281982%29%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77f7c9f142b4f2ed5f5fd07830df045a4acdbf5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,247,201,241,66,180,242,237,95,95,208,120,48,223,4,90,74,205,191,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
