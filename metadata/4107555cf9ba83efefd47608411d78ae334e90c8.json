Exploring the implications of this insight for professions including nursing, teaching, social work, engineering and the clergy, this volume aims to encourage informed debate on what it means to be a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“professionalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in this globalised 21st century.\n\n The book argues that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“becomingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ a professional is a lifelong process in which individual professional identities are constructed through formal education, workplace interactions and popular culture. The book advocates the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ongoingnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of developing a professional self throughout oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s professional life. What emerges is a concept of becoming a professional different from the isolated, rugged, individualistic approach to traditional professional practice as represented in popular culture. It is a book for the reflective professional.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4107555cf9ba83efefd47608411d78ae334e90c8","amp;dn":"%5C%22Becoming%5C%22+a+Professional","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4107555cf9ba83efefd47608411d78ae334e90c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,7,85,92,249,186,131,239,239,212,118,8,65,29,120,174,51,78,144,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
