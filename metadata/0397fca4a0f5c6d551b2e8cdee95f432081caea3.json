During the chaotic last months of the Khrushchev regime, a teenager's errand to the village market for bread ends in a nightmarish confrontation with local police. Sadistic shower room confrontation, unsanitary detention facilities and a tomblike prison cell become classrooms on the horrors of the human soul. As his fellow captives are tortured, die or quietly lose their minds, the naive 13-year-old becomes an unwilling witness to startling lessons in honor, hatred, conscience and survival. Contains nudity and mature themes.  Written by Jim Stark.\n\nRip info\n========\n\nSize: 592 MB\nVideo encoding: Xvid 1037kbps 23.976fps\nAudio encoding: MP3 128kbps 48kHz\nHash MD5: 15889fcd6b168a1f0d1edc0bbef10ea0\nRipped with: dvd::rip (http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/)\n\nRelease team's comments\n=======================\n\n  This film came to our attention when we watched it on a friend's house. We couldn't believe this film has been forgot by its own producer, and got no international attention and distribution. It's very hard to find it, either on DVD shops or for rent, so we think we *have* to upload this to the Internet to give this film the distribution it diserves.\n\nWhere to buy\n============\n\n  As far as we know, this film is only available in NTSC VHS and DVD (very bad quality by the way) in USA. So it's no worth buying if you're not in the NTSC region. Even if you're in there, this rip actually plays *better* than the original DVD in a computer.\n\n  I'm not aware of any distributor who sells this film on DVD with higher quality and unembedded subtitles. If you know about one, please post it on the comments. Thanks.\n\nA final note\n============\n\n  Thanks to The Pirate Bay team, who provide us with a real free (as in freedom) BitTorrent tracker, even when various governments and corporations are pressing them to close the site. Releasing this title through the Bay is our modest way to support this great site.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0397fca4a0f5c6d551b2e8cdee95f432081caea3","amp;dn":"Lessons.at.the.End.of.Spring.%5B1990.USSR%5D%5BDVDRip%5D%5BXvid%5D%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0397fca4a0f5c6d551b2e8cdee95f432081caea3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,151,252,164,160,245,198,213,81,178,232,205,238,149,244,50,8,28,174,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
