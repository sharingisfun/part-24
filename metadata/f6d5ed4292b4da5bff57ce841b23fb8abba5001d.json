The band was known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, country, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, and for live performances of long musical improvisation. &quot;Their music,&quot; writes Lenny Kaye, &quot;touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.&quot; These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead &quot;the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world&quot;. They were ranked 57th in the issue The Greatest Artists of all Time by Rolling Stone magazine. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.\n\nEven by studio standards, Built to Last isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the finest representation of the Grateful DeadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capabilities, but it does fare better than common perception would lead one to believe. Still, old habits die hard, and when the Grateful Dead began working on what would become its final studio album, it quickly forgot all of the lessons that it had learned from the making of In the Dark. Perhaps if the group had taken just a little more time to allow its songs to ripen Ã¢â‚¬â€ the ensemble had started to tinker with MIDI-technology, but it hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet mastered its new toy Ã¢â‚¬â€ the process might have yielded a minor masterpiece. After all, the set was full of moments that could have been something more had they only been given the chance to mature. In the end, however, Built to Last was rushed to completion, its components were stitched together from individually recorded accompaniments, and its material just didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t flow in a seamlessly cohesive fashion. As a result, the outing frequently felt forced, and it essentially was a return to the disjointed imperfection of Shakedown Street.\n\nNOTE:\n\nFor some reason, HDTracks lists this album as 24Bit-96Khz, but then released it in only 16Bit-44.1Khz.\nThey do state this on their website, but give no explanation for it.\nI only uploaded this album to complete the collection.\n\nHDTracks PCM-16Bit-44.1Khz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6d5ed4292b4da5bff57ce841b23fb8abba5001d","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+Built+To+Last+%281989%29+2013+HDTracks+24-96-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6d5ed4292b4da5bff57ce841b23fb8abba5001d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,213,237,66,146,180,218,91,255,87,206,132,27,35,251,138,187,165,0,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
