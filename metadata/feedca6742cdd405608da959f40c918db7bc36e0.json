Use Advanced JPEG Compressor for a variety of personal or business purposes: Easily reduce the large file sizes of your graphic files Impressive file size reduction without losses in picture quality! Smaller files take less space and up and download faster. Effectively optimize photos for faster loading from the Web and faster sending by e-mail - avoid exceeding size limits. Compress scanned documents for storage/transferal.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Interactivity - the process of compression becomes visual, effectively trading image quality with file size by adjusting the compressor's settings. It also offers a preview of the resulting image immediately in the result image preview window\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Multi-document interface allows you to work with many images at the same time, enabling you to view and compare different compression parameters applied to either the same or different images\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Advanced JPEG compression engine, specially optimized for higher image quality, considerably reduces the file size of images and provides the most comprehensive set of options to tune the compression level\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Compression profiles considerably improve processing of multiple images with similar characteristics. A compression profile contains the most important compression parameters along with resizing information. You can create, save, edit and apply named compression profiles\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Photo hosting integration allows you to save photos in the Web. Our photo hosting service allows you to upload and store your photos on our web server. Use this feature to share your photos online - email links, insert photos in forums, use for auctions, etc.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Graphic Detail Quality Equalizer is a unique feature that gives you significant flexibility in adjusting the compressed image quality. Its 5 bands are intended to tune the compression level applied to the image details with different sizes (ranging from large to small)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Compression-oriented image prefiltering helps to achieve better compression/optimization results and improve the visual appearance of an image. You can choose one of five filters and change the level and radius (depth) of applying the active filter\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Separate compression sliders for Luma(intensity) and Chroma(color) channels allow you to gain better compression results, eliminate color artefacts, and significantly improve the compressed image quality\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Hold the defined compression ratio is a unique feature for graphic software that allows you to create images whose file size is limited by the defined compression ratio (like the &quot;bit rate&quot; parameter for audio files), and does not depend on their content\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Selective image compression - some areas of the image can be compressed more or less than others. This useful feature allows you to save high quality for the most important parts of the image (faces,etc.), and lower for the rest, achieving excellent compression results\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Progressive JPEG images support; images in this format being published on the Web will be incrementally displayed (gradually improving their quality) during loading from the Internet or other communications\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Additional options for adjusting precision of compression allow you to get the best result depending on the priority: small file size or high image quality (which means large file size)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ability to acquire images from TWAIN compliant devices - such as scanners or digital cameras\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Image Resizing(Resampling) by using one of three implemented high-quality interpolation methods\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Viewing/Editing the invisible text (signature, copyright notice, comments, etc.) embedded in your JPEG file\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Possibility to crop unnecessary portions of the image\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Easy-to-use and highly customizable user interface\n\nHome Page - http://www.winsoftmagic.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feedca6742cdd405608da959f40c918db7bc36e0","amp;dn":"Advanced+JPEG+Compressor+2011.9.2.99","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feedca6742cdd405608da959f40c918db7bc36e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,237,202,103,66,205,212,5,96,141,169,89,244,12,145,141,183,188,54,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
