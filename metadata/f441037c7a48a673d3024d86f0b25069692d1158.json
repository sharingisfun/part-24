Her voice has the same rich, sexy textures as Metric vocalist, Emily Haines. She can slither around a melody like a pro, with a sixties tinged falsetto or with a caressing purr. George has an array of lovely and silky compositions here. In &quot;Mistress&quot;, she tackles a provocative subject with enough suggestive vocal acrobatics to electrify. But the clincher is that All Rise is not limited to torch songs. &quot;Genius&quot; is a propulsive gem which has touches of Aimee Mann's guitar pop. While &quot;Fools in Love&quot; is an introspective piece, with Inara singing about her low opinions of people in love but it's a flippant delivery, one gets from the gently strummed guitars and the devastating melody, that this woman would rather be in love more than anything. It's a song you'd expect from the sixties, seventies female folkies. It's this combination of old and modern elements of pop music that makes this record so compelling and one of the unsung masterpieces of 2005.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f441037c7a48a673d3024d86f0b25069692d1158","amp;dn":"Inara+George...All+Rise%282007%29%5BFLAC%5DDTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f441037c7a48a673d3024d86f0b25069692d1158","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,65,3,124,122,72,166,115,211,2,77,134,240,178,80,105,105,45,17,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
