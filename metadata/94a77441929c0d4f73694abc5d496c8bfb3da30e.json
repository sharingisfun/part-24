Since its last record, 2002's Read Music/Speak Spanish, the crusade against disenfranchisement and corruption in America Ã¢â‚¬â€ this band's founding fire Ã¢â‚¬â€ has changed course and broadened. Consider the headlines of the last few years alone: Occupy Wall Street, WikiLeaks, police brutality, Edward Snowden, the transgressions of the NSA. In mid-2015, the fodder for agitated, political punk is both endless and rich.\n\n  Arist bio by Drago Bonacich\n\n  Indie rock outfit Desaparecidos became a side project for Bright Eyes' singer/guitarist Conor Oberst by the end of 2000. The band's debut came when they played live for the first time at a benefit concert on April 21, 2001. Named Desaparecidos after the 1970s practice of some South American governments kidnapping dissidents and tossing them out of airplanes into the ocean, Desaparecidos' lyrics are based on the loss of human values, supported by high-energy vocals, heavy drums, and powerful chords. In 2001, the single &quot;The Happiest Place on Earth&quot; brought forward their debut album, titled Read Music/Speak Spanish. Oberst announced the group's disbandment the following year, as by this time, the increasingly successful Bright Eyes had become a full time job. Desaparecidos came together for a one-off reunion show in 2010, and by 2012 had officially reunited with plans to record a new album via Epitaph Records in 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94a77441929c0d4f73694abc5d496c8bfb3da30e","amp;dn":"Desaparecidos+-+Payola+%282015%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94a77441929c0d4f73694abc5d496c8bfb3da30e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,167,116,65,146,156,13,79,115,105,74,188,93,73,108,139,251,61,163,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
