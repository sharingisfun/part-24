That was a terrific album of the &amp;#039;89 version of the band, the only problem was a less than great sound quality. The same applies here, but with a caveat: the cover art. For whatever reason, this reissue features a cover photo of the Burritos circa 1969. Don&amp;#039;t buy this expecting Hillman and Parsons. This is Beland and Guilbeau-- a better band at any rate.\n\nInformation Disc:\n? Artist:    Flying Burrito Brothers\n? Title:     Live in Europe\n? Year:     1997\n?
