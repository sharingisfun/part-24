It was released in 1976.\n\nRun with The Pack was recorded in France with The Rolling Stones Mobile Truck in September 1975 with engineer Ron Nevison and mixed in Los Angeles by Eddie Kramer. The album was the only original Bad Company album not to feature artwork from Hipgnosis as it featured artwork from Kosh instead.\n\nThe album peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard's Pop Albums chart (North America) and was the band's first US Platinum certified album. It has sold to date three million copies in the US alone.\n\nTheir cover of the Coasters single &quot;Young Blood&quot; peaked at No. 20. The album also spawned rock radio classics &quot;Silver, Blue and Gold&quot;, &quot;Live For the Music&quot;, and the title track. Although &quot;Silver, Blue and Gold&quot; remains one of the band's most popular compositions, the song was never released as a single.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Live for the Music&quot; (Mick Ralphs) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:58\n    &quot;Simple Man&quot; (Mick Ralphs) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:37\n    &quot;Honey Child&quot; (Paul Rodgers/Mick Ralphs/Boz Burrell/Simon Kirke) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:15\n    &quot;Love Me Somebody&quot; (Paul Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:09\n    &quot;Run with the Pack&quot; (Paul Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:21\n    &quot;Silver, Blue &amp; Gold&quot; (Paul Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:03\n    &quot;Young Blood&quot; (Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller/Doc Pomus) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:37\n    &quot;Do Right by Your Woman&quot; (Paul Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:51\n    &quot;Sweet Lil' Sister&quot; (Mick Ralphs) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:29\n    &quot;Fade Away&quot; (Paul Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:54\n\n\n    Paul Rodgers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, piano, guitar\n    Mick Ralphs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Simon Kirke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Boz Burrell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cdc8b6fa6abb14d7107a41fc6e16b862f8295d9","amp;dn":"Bad+Company+-+Run+With+The+Pack+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cdc8b6fa6abb14d7107a41fc6e16b862f8295d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,220,139,111,166,171,177,77,113,7,164,31,198,225,107,134,47,130,149,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
