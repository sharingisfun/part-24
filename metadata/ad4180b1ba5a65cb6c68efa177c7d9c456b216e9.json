Manchester City declared their intent to regain the title they won in 2011-12 by beating Newcastle 4-0 in their first match of the current campaign. However, Alan Pardew's men have recovered from that disastrous start to climb the table, thanks largely to the goal-scoring form of France striker Loic Remy. But City boast plenty of firepower themselves, with Sergio Aguero, Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko all proven finishers. Liverpool's victory against Stoke in August was the first of three successive 1-0 wins for Brendan Rodgers' side. However, the Reds know from experience that the Potters are tough nuts to crack on home turf - Liverpool have lost their last three Premier League games at the Stadium of Light. Mark and guests also look back at the goals from Saturday's seven matches.\n\n\nNotes: Captured at 50fps to give more fluid and smoother movement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad4180b1ba5a65cb6c68efa177c7d9c456b216e9","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2+2014-01-12+720p+50fps+HDTV+x264-wAm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad4180b1ba5a65cb6c68efa177c7d9c456b216e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,65,128,177,186,90,101,203,108,104,239,161,119,199,217,196,86,178,22,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
