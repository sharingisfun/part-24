Their lyrics are informed by a complete disregard for societal norms. They formed in 1979 and released their first album in 1981. The band's biography, Argh Fuck Kill: The Story of the Dayglo Abortions, by author Chris Walter, was published in 2010 by Gofuckyerself Press.\n\nIn 1988, a Nepean, Ontario police officer instigated a criminal investigation of the Dayglos after his daughter brought home a copy of Here Today, Guano Tomorrow.\n\nTwo albums featured in the resulting trial; the covers and the lyrical content being showcased by the prosecution. Here Today, Guano Tomorrow had a cover showing a picture of a hamster eating from a box of chocolates on nice satin sheets, along with a glass of wine. A gun points at the hamster, and the back cover shows a depiction of the resulting carnage.\n\nThe previous album, Feed Us A Fetus, was perhaps a little less graphic, with a depiction of a baked fetus on the table in front of Ronald and Nancy Reagan.\n\nThis resulted in the criminal prosecution of Fringe Product, their label at the time, for distribution and possession with intent to distribute of obscene materialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the first such prosecution since the offense entered the criminal code in 1959. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty.\n\nThe Dayglos, for the title song of their next album, Two Dogs Fucking, concerned the supposed priggishness of Ottawa's public officials leading directly to the extinction of the human race.\n\nDayglo Abortions singer, Gymbo Jak, also sings in Maximum RNR.[1]\n\nOn their most recent album, the Dayglos showed a new-found political awareness. Holy Shiite has song titles such as &quot;America Eats Her Young&quot;, &quot;Christina Bin Laden&quot;, &quot;Scientology&quot;, and &quot;Where's Bin Laden?&quot;. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeed us A Fetus 1986\n\n\nFeed Us a Fetus is a 1986 album by the Dayglo Abortions. It contains some songs from their first album, which start on track 11 with &quot;Kill the Hosers&quot;, but the track listing has been mixed up. Track 22 is a bonus song.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Stupid Songs&quot; - 2:14\n2.\t&quot;Argh Fuck Kill - Die Sinner Die&quot; - 2:15\n3.\t&quot;Bedtime Story&quot; - 2:53\n4.\t&quot;My Girl&quot; - 1:25\n5.\t&quot;Dogfarts&quot; - 2:06\n6.\t&quot;Inside My Head&quot; - 1:21\n7.\t&quot;Wake Up America&quot; - 2:39\n8.\t&quot;Proud to Be a Canadian&quot; - 1:57\n9.\t&quot;Stupid World&quot; - 2:48\n10.\t&quot;Ronald McRaygun&quot; - 1:33\n11.\t&quot;Kill the Hosers&quot; - 1:20\n12.\t&quot;Religious Bumfucks &quot; - 1:45\n13.\t&quot;1967&quot; - 1:48\n14.\t&quot;I Killed Mommy&quot; - 2:00\n15.\t&quot;I'm My Own God&quot; - 1:55\n16.\t&quot;Used to Be in Love&quot; - 2:15\n17.\t&quot;Suicide&quot; - 1:58\n18.\t&quot;The Idiot&quot; - 1:26\n19.\t&quot;Germ Attack&quot; - 1:28\n20.\t&quot;Scared of People - Black Sabbath&quot; - 4:22\n21.\t&quot;I Want to Be East Indian&quot; - 2:14\n22.\t&quot;Rape Kill &amp; Whiter Than Hitler&quot; [Bonus Track]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere Today, Guano Tomorrow 1987\n\n\n\nHere Today, Guano Tomorrow is a 1987 album by the Dayglo Abortions. This is one of the very few late 80's punk albums that was available on 8 track.[citation needed] The cassette version was on high quality Cr02 (chrome) tape with Dolby, also very unusual for indie labels of the day.\n\nFoobles the Clown pays ode to 'Fuck My Shit Stinks' on his 'Tribute to Dayglo Abortions' YouTube upload. The song plays in the background while Foobles places a hamster in a blender, which eventually is turned on . This video was criticized very much until Foobles himself explained that the hamster was taken out of the blender and replaced with a mixture of &quot;different things&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Fuck My Shit Stinks&quot; - 3:16 (Murray Acton)\n2.\t&quot;Fuck Satan to Death&quot; - 3:28 (N.
