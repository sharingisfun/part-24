Concocted around the notion of a cult, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to see people being converted to the dreamy, blissful melodies on the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album, Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs. There is no denying the religious yet nondenominational undertones to these songs, heavy in the wisdom of living for today and loving your fellow man. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not talking about God; weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking about spiritualism. What struck me most about the songs is that sense of optimism. Though many bands of the neo-psychedelic movement embody the same sounds, their lyrics are much bleaker and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t offer the hope that is deeply embedded in the songs of the Davidians.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d06fd7fc401c4e4399111d211abc7d789650699","amp;dn":"The+Stevenson+Ranch+Davidians+-+Psalms%2C+Hymns%2C+%26amp%3B+Spiritual+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d06fd7fc401c4e4399111d211abc7d789650699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,6,253,127,196,1,196,228,57,145,17,210,17,171,199,215,137,101,6,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
