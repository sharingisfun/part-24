One of the astronauts is killed by a creature, but the other, Woodrow Decker, is transported into a pastoral countryside by the monolith. Here he rapidly ages until he dies and is converted by the monolith into an embryo-type creature referred to as a 'new seed' to explore the galaxy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:167963c31279167c16e91090fba3453df062a7af","amp;dn":"2001%2C+A+Space+Odyssey+%281976-1977%29+%23001.cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"167963c31279167c16e91090fba3453df062a7af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,121,99,195,18,121,22,124,22,233,16,144,251,163,69,61,240,98,167,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
