Like so many other live records of the era, it was overshadowed by BrownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s blazing landmark album Live At The Apollo, then further eclipsed a year later by another Apollo LP. Adding to the obscurity is that, although intended to highlight Soul Brother No. 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s groundbreaking ascension to headlining status at New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Madison Square Garden, the album was actually recorded over several performances at a nightclub in Cherry Hill, New Jersey \n\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got two hours of straight-ahead JBE: the opening instrumental set, with the boss leading his incredible orchestra from behind the organ, including 10 minutes of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNight Train,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and, for the first time, the full Star Time portion of the show - highlighted by an unedited version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPapaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Got A Brand New Bag,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tracks left off the LP including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCome Rain Or Come Shine,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and some alternate versions of what was included on the album.\nThe collectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unreleased material, newly mixed from the original four-track master tapes - and sonically rescued from the venueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s haphazard recording techniques - captures the raw excitement of James Brown Experience circa ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“67, resulting in a soaring, searing revue of emerging funk and hit ballads. This Expanded Edition is also unique to all other James Brown live albums, as it features JB and band in a nightclub, not a theater or arena, with a delightfully casual pacing unheard anywhere else. \n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n   1.
