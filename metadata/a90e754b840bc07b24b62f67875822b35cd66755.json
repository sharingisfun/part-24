All hit TV series eventually have one \nof the main characters temporarily going blind or \ngetting amnesia. \n\nSo Trampas loses his memory after a run-in with \noutlaws, but the plot doesn't really go anywhere.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a90e754b840bc07b24b62f67875822b35cd66755","amp;dn":"THE+VIRGINIAN+--+The+Challenge+%28+Don+Galloway%2C+Barbara+Anderson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a90e754b840bc07b24b62f67875822b35cd66755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,14,117,75,132,11,192,123,36,182,47,103,135,88,34,179,92,214,103,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
