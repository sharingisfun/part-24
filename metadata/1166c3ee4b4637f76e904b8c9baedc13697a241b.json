Higher compressive strengths allow for a reduction in the cross-sectional dimensions of columns and walls in buildings. Its greater stiffness allows for increasing building heights while controlling sway and occupant comfort. Civil structures such as bridges have benefited from greater span lengths, shallower beam sections, wider girder spacing, and extended service life.\n\nIllustrated with real life examples, through documented case histories, High-Strength Concrete will be a valuable resource for contractors, producers, inspection agencies, as well as engineers and researchers.\nAbout the Author\n\nMichael Caldarone is a professional engineer with over 20 years experience in concrete material engineering and has been involved with many of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most notable projects involving high-strength concrete. He is the current chair of the American Concrete Institute Committee 363 on High-Strength Concrete.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 272 pages\n    * Publisher: Spon Press; 1 edition (September 12, 2008)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0415404320\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0415404327   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1166c3ee4b4637f76e904b8c9baedc13697a241b","amp;dn":"High+Strength+Concrete+-+A+Practical+Guide%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1166c3ee4b4637f76e904b8c9baedc13697a241b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,102,195,238,75,70,55,247,110,144,75,140,155,174,220,19,105,122,36,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
