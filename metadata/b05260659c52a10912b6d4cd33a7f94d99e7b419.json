The rules are easy: be pleasant, refrain from asking questions, and don't rock the boat. Everything they need is provided for them, from the white uniforms that magically appear in their closets, to their customized cafeteria-style meals. The survivors all eagerly await their big payoff: winning the lottery and being sent to The Island, the only remaining untainted land in the world. But Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) yearns for more from his life and begins to wonder what really lies outside the thick walls. When his best friend, Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson), wins the lottery, he knows that he has to find out the truth about their world before she departs. What he finds is terrifying enough to send Lincoln and Jordan fleeing from the facility to the real world where they quickly discover that they are clones, and that both The Island and global contamination are a ruse. The clones sole purpose is to be harvested for replacement parts when their sponsors need them. With his business now in jeopardy, Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), the founder of the cloning company, hires a crack team led by Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) to track down his escaped product. Wild chase scenes through Los Angeles circa 2050 are punctuated by high-tech transportation as Lincoln and Jordan run for their lives\n\nStars:Scarlett Johansson, Ewan McGregor,Sean Bean\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/6VPYBP.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/6VPYBP.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/TGYL44.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/TGYL44.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/0D4HWC.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/0D4HWC.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/O69YSI.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/O69YSI.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/PDV4LF.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/PDV4LF.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/VRJ1GK.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.grinshare.com/img/VRJ1GK.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : Base Media\nFile size                        : 616 MiB\nDuration                         : 2h 15mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 633 Kbps\nSample                           : Yes\nSubtitles                        : English [srt]\nSource                           : 720 bluray\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nCodec ID/Info                    : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                         : 2h 15mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 501 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 2 642 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 296 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.40:1\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\n\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nDuration                         : 2h 15mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 195 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b05260659c52a10912b6d4cd33a7f94d99e7b419","amp;dn":"The+Island+%5B2005%5D+BRRip+x264+%5BZeberzee%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b05260659c52a10912b6d4cd33a7f94d99e7b419","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,82,96,101,156,82,161,9,18,182,212,205,51,167,249,77,153,231,180,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
