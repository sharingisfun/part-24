I met her in Tokyo in 1950 after leaving three months of fighting in the Korean War (pictures attached). She is my wife. Over the years she has become good enough in English to be able to understand about one-half the speech in an English language movie. With the use of subtitles she can understand 80 to 90% of the dialogue. I, of course, understand well.\n\nHer being Japanese has led to there being quite a few Japanese language movies in our house. That fact has forced me to develop the ability to depend entirely upon English subtitles for my understanding those movies. I do pretty well.\n\nThe attached Japanese anime video is a chance for you to try it out and see if\nyou, too, can rely entirely on English subtitles to figure out what is going on, while simultaneously watching it. It's not easy. But it gets easier with time.\n\nIf this submission is well received I might try uploading a couple grown-up Japanese language movies. I don't much like the anime videos.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1afdcee2b1f86c88e8b4799933a2801b1bc9679a","amp;dn":"Spirited+Away+anime+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1afdcee2b1f86c88e8b4799933a2801b1bc9679a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,253,206,226,177,248,108,136,232,180,121,153,51,162,128,27,27,201,103,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
