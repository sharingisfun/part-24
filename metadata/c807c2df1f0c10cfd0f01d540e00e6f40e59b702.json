I did NOT get an invite and leaked it (that would be a dick move). Here's how I found the download (direct from their server):\n\n1) Looked through the public bug reports\n2) Found the version number of the beta\n3) Plugged it into the download link for the current version\n4) ??????\n5) PROFIT!\n\n^ Use this info to secure your downloads!\n\nHope you enjoy!\n\n(This beta is supposed to be public in January, so for those who can't wait. You're welcome)\n\nAnyone has the Linux or updated Windows version, please post a link.
