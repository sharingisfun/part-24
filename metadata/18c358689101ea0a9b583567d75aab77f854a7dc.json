Whoop Whoop!\n\nThis here IS the official Twiztid - A New Nightmare Mixtape album!\n\nPure freshness. Download, Seed, ENJOY!\n\nTracks are as follows:\n\n1.  Wake Me Up\n2.  Down With Us\n3.  Unjust Love\n4.  The Deep End\n5.  Sick Man\n6.  Screaming Out\n7.  Wasted\n8.  Falling Down\n9.  Monstrosity\n\n\n\nNOTE: Ripped @ 320kbps/MP3 - Don't bitch. I got this 2 days before it was out. I've listened to it, sounds great. But I don't think it's a TRUE 320kps rip. Goes hard though :)\n\nI've tried my best to deliver quality to you at the earliest times possible.
