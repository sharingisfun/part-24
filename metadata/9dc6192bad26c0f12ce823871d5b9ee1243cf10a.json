Naturally, he becomes the target for the Bureau of Yuletide affairs, who send the Ghost of Christmas Past (Leslie Jordan, Will &amp; Grace) to take Cameron on a tour of his previous holidays. But when the ghost has a personal meltdown and abandons Cameron in 1965, the lovely Ghost of Christmas Present (Andrea Roth, Rescue Me) has to rescue the sourpuss--only to find that romantic sparks arise twixt ghost and man. Chasing Christmas won't win any awards, but it's a modest, enjoyable movie with a theme everyone can agree on: Life must be embraced to be fully lived.\n\nIn a world where the holidays are run by the efficient Bureau of Yuletide Affairs, a bitter and burned-out Ghost of Christmas Past decides to go AWOL while on a &quot;mission&quot; and leave his &quot;target&quot; stranded in 1965.\n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!!\n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
