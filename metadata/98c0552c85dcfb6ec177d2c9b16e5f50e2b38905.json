Good Songs, Sound Good! What do you think?\n\nAll this, thanks to my imaginary &quot;Best Indie&quot; friend from PB. It's always nice to meet an idiot like myself. Some recognition maybe. Anyway we listened to about a thousand songs. Most were beautiful, some clearly good and some were just to good to keep quiet. So I put these songs in my September lists (although most of them are a bit older but you might have missed them too). But whatever reason; in my ears, the list has become quite special. The songs really support each other. All in HQ.....
