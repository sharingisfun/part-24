The first side was a concept set of songs \nabout childhood and growing up that allowed Streisand, in the songs &quot;I'm \nFive&quot; and &quot;Sweet Zoo,&quot; to take a comic approach for the first time in several \nalbums. The second side was a set of adult songs performed in Streisand's \nbig, dramatic style. &quot;I Can See It,&quot; her third borrowing from The Fantasticks, \nwas the best yet, and Streisand's first attempt at a Gershwin tune, &quot;Someone \nto Watch over Me,&quot; was at least a qualified success. &quot;I've Got No Strings,&quot; \nfrom the movie Pinocchio, was no &quot;Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf&quot; one of \nthe highlights of her debut album, but it wasn't bad. And best of all was \nStreisand's reading of &quot;My Man,&quot; Fanny Brice's signature song, though it had \nnot been used in Funny Girl, the Broadway show about her life, in which \nStreisand had starred. After this demonstration, however, it would be \ninterpolated into the movie version. My Name Is Barbra won a Grammy Award \nfor Best Female Vocal Performance.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f093c468771b0f3307209971efaed47a0645608e","amp;dn":"Barbra+Streisand+-+My+Name+Is+Barbra+%281965%29+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f093c468771b0f3307209971efaed47a0645608e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,147,196,104,119,27,15,51,7,32,153,113,239,174,212,122,6,69,96,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
