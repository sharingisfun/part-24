Nowhere is that more evident than in this latest collection of stories \nset on the American frontier. The selections include The Nester and the Piute; \nBig Man; Waltz Him Around Again, Shadow; Barney Takes a Hand; When a \nTexan Takes Over; and No Trouble for the Cactus Kid. Even at the best of \ntimes, this is a world in which every man and woman must be responsible for \ntheir own survival.\n\nThe characters in these pulse-pounding stories are vintage L&amp;#039;Amour. \nTogether these stories bring to life the American spirit and confirm Louis \nL&amp;#039;Amour&amp;#039;s place at the very top of the pantheon of American writers.\n\n----\n\nLouis L&amp;#039;Amour is the only novelist in history to receive both the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. He has published ninety \nnovels; twenty-nine short-story collections; two works of nonfiction; a \nmemoir, Education of a Wandering Man; and a volume of poetry, Smoke from \nThis Alter. There are more than 300 million copies of his books in print.\n\n----\n\nJason Culp has appeared on television in Days of Our Lives and General \nHospital and in the film Skinheads. His many theatrical performances include \nthe role of Trigorin in The Seagull.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16f628a821647bac3b0be2d45f58d9b61478303b","amp;dn":"Louis+L%5C%27Amour+-+The+Frontier+Stories+%5BVolume+05%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16f628a821647bac3b0be2d45f58d9b61478303b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,246,40,168,33,100,123,172,59,11,226,212,95,88,217,182,20,120,48,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
