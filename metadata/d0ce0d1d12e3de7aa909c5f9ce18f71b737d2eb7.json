All I've Ever Wanted\n11. Everything Fades Away (Bonustrack)\n\n\nThis album is Mariah's bestseller, for good reason. It contains two of her biggest hits, the pop perfection of &quot;Dreamlover&quot; and the inspiring lyrics of &quot;Hero&quot;. It also includes her beautiful remake of &quot;Without You&quot; as well as the inspiring &quot;Anytime You Need A Friend&quot;. The album is listenable from beginning to end, with no slow spots. Without You is probably Mariah's biggest hit in Europe, landing Miss Carey her first UK no.1. It is a powerful ballad, which surely displays Mariah Carey's ability to take a cover version and make it her own. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 13\nArtist: Mariah Carey\nAlbum: Music Box\nYear: 1993\nGenre: Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0ce0d1d12e3de7aa909c5f9ce18f71b737d2eb7","amp;dn":"Mariah+Carey+-+Music+Box+%5BFLAC-1993%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0ce0d1d12e3de7aa909c5f9ce18f71b737d2eb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,206,13,29,18,227,222,122,169,9,197,249,206,24,247,27,115,125,46,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
