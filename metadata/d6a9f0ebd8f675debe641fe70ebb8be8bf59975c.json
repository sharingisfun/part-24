The Married Man Sex Life Primer 2011 cherry picks the best ideas of books like &quot;The Mystery Method,&quot; &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy,&quot; and the volatile online world of the Pickup Artist a.k.a. &quot;Game&quot; community and merges them with a solid grounding in evolutionary psychology, sociology, biology and behavior modification. The result is a simple, effective plan for men to create sexually exciting marriages for themselves and their wives.\nThe opening covers the underlying ancient &quot;hard-wired&quot; biological and modern social reasons women find men attractive. Athol pulls no punches here and the sexual motivations of women are laid bare. Though rather than framing women as sexually devious and seeking to advantage themselves over men, he explains how their sexual behavior is entirely rational in nature and once understood as such, it becomes very useful information.\nThe second part of the book takes the framework developed in the first part and offers a wealth of tools to put it to practical use. The most important tool is The Male Action Plan, which charges the husband with the task of becoming a better, sexier man and thereby leveraging his increased attractiveness for a better sex life with his wife. As Athol says, &quot;whoever is the most attractive in the relationship is in charge.&quot;\nThe third part of the book is a treasure trove of playful sexy and romantic moves women will find charming and engaging. It's clear that Athol could have a harem of young ladies, but here he displays an endless variety of playful instigation to continually charm just one. The final section is a catchall of serious topics on what not to do, how to choose a wife, the current state of marriage law and a crushingly simple approach to dealing with being cheated on.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6a9f0ebd8f675debe641fe70ebb8be8bf59975c","amp;dn":"+The+Married+Man+Sex+Life+Primer+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6a9f0ebd8f675debe641fe70ebb8be8bf59975c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,169,240,235,216,246,117,222,190,100,31,231,14,187,139,232,191,89,151,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
