His music offered the drama and \nsheer firepower of rock, and his flamboyant live shows likewise proved well \nsuited to arena-sized crowds, yet there was little argument that Vaughan&amp;#039;s \nfealty to the blues remained at the core of his style. This 1996 concert tribute \nunderscores that common denominator through muscular performances from \ncontemporary blues masters who readily (and appropriately) confirm the Texas \nguitarist as a true peer--it&amp;#039;s no small matter that bona fide influences Buddy \nGuy and B.B. King cite the honoree on an equal plane with Vaughan&amp;#039;s most obvious \nrock forebear, Jimi Hendrix.\nKing and Guy are among the stars who interpret Vaughan&amp;#039;s own songbook in live \nperformances backed by either his old band, Double Trouble, or the larger \nTilt-a-Whirl Band. Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Robert Cray, Dr. John, and the \nlate guitarslinger&amp;#039;s big brother, Jimmie Vaughan (himself a major figure since \nhis days with the Fabulous Thunderbirds) all pay gritty musical homage \nnoteworthy for powerhouse guitar work. Whether clad in coveralls (Guy) or Armani \n(Clapton, of course), each reaches the same common ground in the soul-deep \nlanguage of the blues; equally important, the choice of material points up \nVaughan&amp;#039;s sure sense of blues song form and a penchant for tough, frequently \nwitty lyrics that fit snugly into blues traditions. The 80-minute concert also \nintersperses brief interviews with the principals, with the music building \ntoward a satisfying climax in three high-octane jams featuring the headliners in \nlively exchanges. The DVD optimizes the full-frame visuals of the original \nvideotaped special, and the 5.1 audio mix likewise fine-tunes the \nstraightforward stereo mix with some added ambience.\n\nDirector: Gary Menotti\n\nCast    : \n\nJimmie Vaughan ...
