Along the way, they meet a young man named Myg whom the Sensei senses could train to be a hero, much like the Karate Kid. It is revealed that Karate Kid wanted Timber Wolf to plant a seed within the rocks of the rough terrain of Lythlys, completing a legend that if a plant grows on the planet, the planet would grow weak. Since that was the planet that Karate Kid's biological father, Black Dragon, turned to crime, it was important to him. Meanwhile, applicants arrive to try to join the Legion of Super-Heroes. \n \n#55 on  Wizard Magazine's &quot;100 Best Single Issue Comics Since You Were Born&quot; list.\n\nThanks goes to Tol EressÃƒÂ«a for this release.\n\nTales of the Legion of Super-Heroes #314-336:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8939916&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8939916&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTales of the Legion of Super-Heroes #337: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8942143&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8942143&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
