Runtime 76 Minutes.\n\nReview from 'All About Jazz':\nNew West Records proudly introduces Norah Jones: Live From Austin, TX, the latest DVD release from the acclaimed PBS Austin City Limits television series. Taken from the full ACL concert that was then edited into the half hour TV show, the DVD contains previously unreleased performances. The 18 song disc was filmed in Hi-Definition and has DTS 5.1 Surround Sound. \nGrammy Award winning artist Norah Jones recorded this stunning ACL performance on June 14, 2007, the second time the young artist has graced ACL's stage. Jones' music has touches of smoky jazz, country twang and Memphis soul that permeate her original songs. Her emotional, seductive performance is captured on the intimate DVD whether she is playing guitar on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCome Away With Me&quot; or piano on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDon't Know Why.&quot; In addition to her own songs, Norah also plays a few covers including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHands On The Wheel, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ made famous by Willie Nelson and Roy Orbison's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue Bayou.&quot; Norah shares the stage with The Handsome Band as well as special guests J. Walter Hawkes and M. Ward.\n\n\n\n01.Come Away With Me\n02.Those Sweet Words\n03.The Sun Doesn't Like You\n04.Not My Friend\n05.Thinking About You\n06.Be My Somebody\n07.Rosie's Lullaby\n08.Sunrise\n09.Sinkin Soon (Featuring J.
