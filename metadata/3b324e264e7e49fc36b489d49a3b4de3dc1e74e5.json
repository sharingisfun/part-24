Tight and focused (10 tracks, 37 min.), Marley brings forth the best reggae you will find anywhere. (The 2001 remaster adds 2 &quot;long versions&quot; of &quot;Jamming&quot; and &quot;Punky Reggae Party&quot;, the latter not even being on the original album).\nOpener &quot;Natural Mystic&quot; sets the tone: easy-flowing reggae sounds, with Bob's never-absent comments on the way things are, or should be. The album's title track is, at 7+ min, the &quot;monster&quot; track on the album, and one of Bob's best ever. The album also contains the well-known (and hits in the US) &quot;Jamming&quot;, &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot;, and &quot;One Love&quot;.\n\nOne can argue that Marley was never as good in the studio as he was live (check out the live album &quot;Babylon by Bus&quot;), but as far as his studio output is concerned, it never got any better than this. Essential for any Marley fan.\n\nFun fact: Marley was always bigger in Europe than he was in the US. Of the original 10 tracks, 7 were issued as a single in the UK, a feat not repeated until Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot; album, just to give you a sense of &quot;Exodus&quot; impact in 1977. \n\nby Paul Allaer\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Natural Mystic.wma                                \n02 - So Much Things To Say.wma                         \n03 - Guiltiness.wma                                    \n04 - The Heathen.wma                                   \n05 - Exodus.wma                                        \n06 - Jamming.wma                                       \n07 - Waiting In Vain.wma                               \n08 - Turn Your Lights Down Low.wma                     \n09 - Three Little Birds.wma                            \n10 - One Love - People Get Ready.wma                   \n11 - Jamming (Long Version).wma                        \n12 - Punky Reggae Party (Long Version).wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b324e264e7e49fc36b489d49a3b4de3dc1e74e5","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+And+The+Wailers+-+Exodus+%281977%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b324e264e7e49fc36b489d49a3b4de3dc1e74e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,50,78,38,78,126,73,252,54,180,137,212,154,59,77,227,220,30,116,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
