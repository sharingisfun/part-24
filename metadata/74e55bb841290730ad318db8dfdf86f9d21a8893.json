Buckminster Fuller: &quot;Everything I Know&quot; Summary:\n\nBuckminster | ISBN: N/a | 2005 | 56Kbps MP3 | 1068 Mb\n\n\n\nDuring the last two weeks of January 1975 Buckminster Fuller gave an extraordinary series of lectures concerning his entire life's work. These thinking out loud lectures span 42 hours and examine in depth all of FullerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s major inventions and discoveries from the 1927 Dymaxion house, car and bathroom, through the Wichita House, geodesic domes, and tensegrity structures, as well as the contents of Synergetics. Autobiographical in parts, Fuller recounts his own personal history in the context of the history of science and industrialization. The stories behind his Dymaxion car, geodesic domes, World Game and integration of science and humanism are lucidly communicated with continuous reference to his synergetic geometry. Permeating the entire series is his unique comprehensive design approach to solving the problems of the world. Some of the topics Fuller covered in this wide ranging discourse include: architecture, design, philosophy, education, mathematics, geometry, cartography, economics, history, structure, industry, housing and engineering.\n\n\n----------  This mp3 archive is split in to many pieces.

He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, the best known of which is the geodesic dome. Carbon molecules known as fullerenes were later named by scientists for their resemblance to geodesic spheres.\n\nPhilosophy and worldview\n\nThe grandson of a Unitarian minister (Arthur Buckminster Fuller),[13] R. Buckminster Fuller was also Unitarian.[14] Buckminster Fuller was an early environmental activist. He was very aware of the finite resources the planet has to offer, and promoted a principle that he termed &quot;ephemeralization&quot;, which, in essenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½according to futurist and Fuller disciple Stewart BrandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Fuller coined to mean &quot;doing more with less&quot;.[15] Resources and waste material from cruder products could be recycled into making more valuable products, increasing the efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also introduced synergetics, an encompassing term which he used broadly as a metaphoric language for communicating experiences using geometric concepts and, more specifically, to reference the empirical study of systems in transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components. Fuller coined this term long before the term synergy became popular.\n\nBuckminster Fuller was one of the first to propagate a systemic worldview, and he explored principles of energy and material efficiency in the fields of architecture, engineering and design.[16][17] He cited FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois de Chardenedes' opinion that petroleum, from the standpoint of its replacement cost out of our current energy &quot;budget&quot; (essentially, the net incoming solar flux), had cost nature &quot;over a million dollars&quot; per U.S. gallon (US$300,000 per litre) to produce. From this point of view, its use as a transportation fuel by people commuting to work represents a huge net loss compared to their earnings.[18] An encapsulation quotation of his views might be &quot;There is no energy crisis, only a crisis of ignorance&quot;[19][20][21]\n\nFuller was concerned about sustainability and about human survival under the existing socio-economic system, yet remained optimistic about humanity's future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the &quot;technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life,&quot; his analysis of the condition of &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities was not necessary anymore. Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy. &quot;Selfishness,&quot; he declared, &quot;is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable.... War is obsolete.&quot;[22] He criticized previous utopian schemes as too exclusive, and thought this was a major source of their failure. To work, he thought that a utopia needed to include everyone.[23]\n\nFuller also claimed that the natural analytic geometry of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous truss is cyclically tetrahedral.[citation needed]\n\nIn his 1970 book I Seem To Be a Verb, he wrote: &quot;I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary processÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an integral function of the universe.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74e55bb841290730ad318db8dfdf86f9d21a8893","amp;dn":"R.+Buckminster+Fuller+-+Everything+I+Know+%5B42+Hour+MP3+Archive%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74e55bb841290730ad318db8dfdf86f9d21a8893","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,229,91,184,65,41,7,48,173,49,141,184,223,223,134,249,210,26,136,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
