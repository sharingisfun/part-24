Miracle of Allah and Final Testament to Mankind\n\nThe Qur'an represents the fountainhead of Divine guidance\n\nfor every Human Being . The Qur'an confirms the revelations given to\n\nearlier Prophets such as Noah, Abraham, David, Moses and Jesus (peace be\n\nupon them all) All Prophets taught about life after death and gave glad tidings\n\nof paradise for those who obey Him The most sublime poetry in any\n\nlanguage, and a rational message that directly appeals to the human\n\nheart, have caused this Divine book to move nations and civilizations\n\nTorrent preview image\n\nThe Noble Quran is last revelation from our Creator and\n\nlast divine book will remain sole guide for humanity. The matchless\n\nstyle of the Qur'an and the superior wisdom in it are definite evidence\n\nthat is the word of the Creator. In addition, the Qur'an has many\n\nmiraculous attributes proving that it is revelation from the Creator.\n\nOne of these attributes is the fact that a number of scientific truths\n\nthat we have only been able to uncover by the technology century were\n\nstated in the Qur'an 1,400 years ago. In the Qur'an, along with prayers,\n\ncommands, prohibitions and high moral\n\nstandards, our Creator communicates many secrets to mankind. These are\n\ntruly important secrets, and an attentive eye can witness these\n\nthroughout his life. No other source than the Qur'an holds these\n\nsecrets. The Qur'an is the unique source of secrets that those people,\n\nno matter how intelligent, literate or astute they are, could never hope\n\nto find anywhere else.\n\n.......................................\n\nPlease seed and check my other torrents :)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SamirDZ/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SamirDZ/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fenopy.se/user/SamirDZ12061982&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fenopy.se/user/SamirDZ12061982&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease\n\nseed after you finish, and share with others anywhere not just through\n\nthe net only (flash disks, burn to disks, send via emails...etc) to\n\nfriends, colleagues, relatives, neighbors....\n\nI hope that you will benefit from the books and stuff :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3487c3a03e051135f5667e4689bc7c47c4784fb","amp;dn":"filipino+translation+of+Quran.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3487c3a03e051135f5667e4689bc7c47c4784fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,72,124,58,3,224,81,19,95,86,103,228,104,155,199,196,124,71,132,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
