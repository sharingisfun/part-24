The song has gathered major air-play and sales recently, and is living up to Perry's repetition of HOT HOT songs. Like &quot;I Kissed A Girl&quot; the song has a rock style beat to it but also has features of Hot N Cold and Ur So Gay.\n\nWaking Up In Vegas currently is Katy Perry's most radio friendly song. Listeners agree.\n\nAlthough previous single, Thinking Of U did poorly compared to Hot N Cold and I Kissed A Girl, Perry is pulling back up with Waking Up In Vegas, which is sure to be a hit.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ed7dd9ba51c641b48145bb619086cc0f8593ed4","amp;dn":"Katy+Perry+-+Waking+Up+In+Vegas+%5BOfficial+New+Single+2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ed7dd9ba51c641b48145bb619086cc0f8593ed4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,215,221,155,165,28,100,27,72,20,91,182,25,8,108,192,248,89,62,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
