Take a trip with the Magician from Riga as he invites you to share his thoughts and feelings as he does battle for the world title.\n\nInternational Grandmaster Andy Soltis: &quot;Mikhail Tal's splendid account of his world championship match victory is one of the masterpieces of the golden age of annotation - before insights and feelings and flashes of genius were reduced to mere moves and Informant symbols. This is simply the best book written about a world championship match by a contestant. That shouldn't be a surprise because Tal was the finest writer to become world champion.&quot;\n\nMisha is no longer with us, but his highly acclaimed, deeply annotated account of his ascent of Mount Olympus continues to impress and intrigue players of all generations and strengths.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5158b8a3ba4596027647ef66d203c547ff5c11b7","amp;dn":"Tal-Botvinnik+1960+%28Mikhail+Tal%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5158b8a3ba4596027647ef66d203c547ff5c11b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,88,184,163,186,69,150,2,118,71,239,102,210,3,197,71,255,92,17,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
