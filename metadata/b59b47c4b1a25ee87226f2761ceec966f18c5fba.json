Will it hurt his draft stock? Vote Ã‚Â»\nSam is eligible for the NFL draft in May. Assuming that he is drafted, Sam could become the first openly gay player in the history of the NFL.\n\n&quot;I understand how big this is,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.&quot;\n\nIn 2014, &quot;Gay Man to Enter Workforce&quot; has the everyday-occurrence sound of a headline in The Onion. But when the NFL is involved, it's a first -- and potentially a landmark moment -- in the history of American sports.\n\nSam's decision to speak out now comes after his experience two weeks ago at the Senior Bowl, where, he said, many already seemed aware of his sexual orientation.\n\n&quot;I didn't realize how many people actually knew, and I was afraid that someone would tell or leak something out about me,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to own my truth. ... No one else should tell my story but me.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b59b47c4b1a25ee87226f2761ceec966f18c5fba","amp;dn":"ESPN%27s+Outside+The+Lines+-+Michael+Sam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b59b47c4b1a25ee87226f2761ceec966f18c5fba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,155,71,196,177,162,94,232,114,38,242,118,28,238,201,102,241,140,95,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
