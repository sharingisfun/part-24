Without any lead, he is informed by Sheriff Reed about a corpse of a woman that was found one hour before the explosion, but burnt with the same explosive. He is invited by FBI Agent Pryzwarra to join the surveillance team leaded by Jack McCready in the investigations, using a time window and Einstein-Rosen bridge through seven satellites to look back four and half days in time. He discloses the identity of the mysterious dead woman called Claire Kuchever and decides to follow her last moments trying to find the criminal. Along the surveillance, Doug falls in love for Claire and tries to change destiny, saving her life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2824cd7e8a72da1d244730f1f721d37baf27c5c","amp;dn":"Deja+Vu+-2006-+swesub+%28720p%29+-+%5BCrysie%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2824cd7e8a72da1d244730f1f721d37baf27c5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,130,76,215,232,167,45,161,210,68,115,15,31,114,29,55,186,242,124,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
