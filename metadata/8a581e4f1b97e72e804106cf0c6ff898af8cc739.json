W. Duncan\n\ngenres: Science, Health, Cooking\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThe &quot;cold-drawn&quot; Arachis oil (pea-nut or earth-nut oil) has a pleasant flavour, resembling that of kidney beans. The &quot;cold-drawn&quot; SesamÃƒÂ© oil has an agreeable taste, and is considered equal to Olive oil for edible purposes. The best qualities are rather difficult to obtain; those usually sold being much inferior to Peach-kernel and Olive oils. Cotton-seed oil is the cheapest of the edible ones. Salad oil, not sold under any descriptive name, is usually refined Cotton-seed oil, with perhaps a little Olive oil to impart a richer flavour.\n\nThe solid fats sold as butter and lard substitutes, consist of deodorised cocoanut oil, and they are excellent for cooking purposes. It is claimed that biscuits, &amp;c., made from them may be kept for a much longer period, without showing any trace of rancidity, than if butter or lard had been used. They are also to be had agreeably flavoured by admixture with almond, walnut, &amp;c., &quot;cream.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a581e4f1b97e72e804106cf0c6ff898af8cc739","amp;dn":"The+Chemistry+of+Food+and+Nutrition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a581e4f1b97e72e804106cf0c6ff898af8cc739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,88,30,79,27,151,231,46,128,65,6,207,12,111,248,152,175,140,199,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
