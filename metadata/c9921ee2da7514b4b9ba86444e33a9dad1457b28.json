The band is the brainchild of singer-songwriter Jamie Stewart, who has been its only constant member since its inception. His current bandmates are Angela Seo and percussionist Ches Smith. The band's name is taken from the 1998 Chinese film Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl.\n\nXiu Xiu's music draws heavily from several disparate genres including post-punk, 80's synth pop, noise, ambient, techno, asian percussive music, modern classical, and folk. Musically, the band will often blend cacophonous percussion and experimental structures with lush hooks and diverging lyrical styles.\n\n::Dear God, I Hate Myself::\n\nDear God, I Hate Myself is the forthcoming seventh studio album by American indie rock band Xiu Xiu set for release on February 23, 2010. This is their first album since the departure of Caralee McElroy. The album features new member Angela Seo on piano, synth, and drum programming, with production handled by Jamie Stewart and Deerhoof's Greg Saunier.\n\n::Tracklisting::\n\n   1. Gray Death\n   2.
