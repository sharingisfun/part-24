Fuzzy control is exceptionally practical and cost-effective due to its unique ability to accomplish tasks without knowing the mathematical model of the system, even if it is nonlinear, time varying and complex. Nevertheless, compared with the conventional control technology, most fuzzy control applications are developed in an ad hoc manner with little analytical understanding and without rigorous system analysis and design.\r\nFuzzy Control and Modeling is the only book that establishes the analytical foundations for fuzzy control and modeling in relation to the conventional linear and nonlinear theories of control and systems. The coverage is up-to-date, comprehensive, in-depth and rigorous. Numeric examples and applications illustrate the utility of the theoretical development.\r\n\r\nImportant topics discussed include:\r\n\r\nStructures of fuzzy controllers/models with respect to conventional fuzzy controllers/models\r\nAnalysis of fuzzy control and modeling in relation to their classical counterparts\r\nStability analysis of fuzzy systems and design of fuzzy control systems\r\nSufficient and necessary conditions on fuzzy systems as universal approximators\r\nReal-time fuzzy control systems for treatment of life-critical problems in biomedicine\r\nFuzzy Control and Modeling is a self-contained, invaluable resource for professionals and students in diverse technical fields who aspire to analytically study fuzzy control and modeling","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af797b3385c470dfbe0c45eaf8e76da1e2326983","amp;dn":"Fuzzy+Control+and+Modeling+-+Analytical+Foundations+and+Applicat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af797b3385c470dfbe0c45eaf8e76da1e2326983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,121,123,51,133,196,112,223,190,12,69,234,248,231,109,161,226,50,105,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
