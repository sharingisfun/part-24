Calvin keeps a knife close and sleeps with one eye open, even years after his father has left the family. A summer vacation spent at their late grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estate promises him and his sister the chance to leave their problems behind. \n\nInstead of blissful freedom, they find the old house harbors secrets at every turn, like a mysterious stone door in the forest with rumored powers to give its entrants the gift of future-seeing. When Calvin faces the return of his seemingly-reformed father, he throws himself through the door to receive the gift of foresight. But the door offers more doubt than certainty, and the future he sees is riddled with disturbing confusion. With a revenge-obsessed lawyer hunting him down and a secret society out to control him, Calvin must figure out how to stop what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s started before he loses what he holds most dear. \n\nAs he battles the legacies of his past and the shadows of his future, Calvin must accept help from unlikely sources, give trust he never thought possible, and learn that the greatest challenges lie not in the things to come, but in the present moment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ce2d0a3b8a817db5f1d749ff7c0a7980565cfae","amp;dn":"Forecast+by+Elise+Stephens+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ce2d0a3b8a817db5f1d749ff7c0a7980565cfae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,226,208,163,184,168,23,219,95,29,116,159,247,192,167,152,5,101,207,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
