Their mostly instrumental music fuses jazz, southern rock, bluegrass and classical forms in an often unique style. Steve Morse, the Dregs lead guitarist and primary song writer, is best known as the founder of the Dixie Dregs, and the guitar player in Deep Purple since 1994. He is widely known for his stylistically diverse compositional skills and virtuosic abilities on the guitar, and was voted \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Best Overall Guitarist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; by Guitar Player magazine for five years in a row, qualifying him for their \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Guitar Player Hall of Fame\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, the only other members being Steve Howe of Yes and Eric Johnson. \n\nIn 1973, Steve Morse (guitar), Andy West (bass), Allen Sloan (violin) and Bart Yarnal (drums) met while students at the University of Miami\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s School of Music to play as Rock Ensemble II. West also attended Georgia State University for a year while studying cello and music theory &amp; composition along with Parrish. Parrish remained at GSU during the academic school years only to return to Augusta, Georgia during summer breaks - re-establishing the guitar/bass/keyboards/drums quartet with Morse, West, Parrish, and Gilbert Frayer (drums) performing as opening acts for concerts and headlining local gigs as the Dixie Dregs.\n\nAt the time, the University of Miami hosted a lively musical community, including future greats Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. In 1975, the group\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s first effort, The Great Spectacular was recorded at the University. Approximately 1,000 copies of the original LP were pressed. The album was reissued in 1997 in CD form.\n\nBased on the strength of a three song demo and a tip from former Allman Brothers Band members Chuck Leavell and Twiggs Lyndon, Capricorn Records signed them in late 1976 to record Free Fall (1977). Former Dixie Grit/Dixie Dregs keyboardist Mark Parrish rejoined the group later that year. The moderate success and critical acclaim of Free Fall led to their 1978 effort, What If, supported by their first tour with dates in New York, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and California.\n\nTheir third album, Night of the Living Dregs (featuring Morse, West, Sloan, Parrish, and Morgenstein), was released in April 1979, gaining the band their first Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance - won that year by Paul McCartney\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s band Wings. Night of the Living Dregs included studio recordings as well as compositions performed live and recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival on July 23, 1978. Ken Scott - The Beatles\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' and producer/arranger George Martin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s right-hand man and engineer - produced both Dixie Dregs albums What If and Night of the Living Dregs.\n\nIn October 1979, Capricorn Records declared bankruptcy, and the band was signed by Arista Records in January 1980, to create three albums. At that time, keyboardist Parrish left and was replaced by T Lavitz. Later that year, Dregs of the Earth (featuring Morse, West, Sloan, Lavitz, and Morgenstein) was released.\n\nThe 8 albums included in this discography represent the original configuration of Dixie Dregs between 1975 and 1982. \n\nThe Great Spectacular is the first Dixie Dregs album. It was originally released on vinyl in 1976, and again on CD 21 years later.\n\nGreat Spectacular Tracklist:\n1.\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Refried Funky Chicken\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n2.\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Holiday\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n3.\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Wages of Weirdness\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n4.\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;T.O.
