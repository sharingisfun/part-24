Julian McClements (WP, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-84569-151-6\r\n\r\nIt is widely accepted that the creation of novel foods or improvement of existing foods largely depends on a strong understanding and awareness of the intricate interrelationship between the nanoscopic, microscopic and macroscopic features of foods and their bulk physiochemical properties, sensory attributes and healthfulness. With its distinguished editor and array of international contributors, Understanding and controlling the microstructure of complex foods provides a review of current understanding of significant aspects of food structure and methods for its control.\r\n\r\nPart one focuses on the fundamental structural elements present in foods such as polysaccharides, proteins and fats and the forces which hold them together. Part two discusses novel analytical techniques which can provide information on the morphology and behaviour of food materials. Chapters cover atomic force microscopy, image analysis, scattering techniques and computer analysis. Chapters in part three examine how the principles of structural design can be employed to improve performance and functionality of foods. The final part of the book discusses how knowledge of structural and physicochemical properties can be implemented to improve properties of specific foods such as ice-cream, spreads, protein-based drinks, chocolate and bread dough.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding and controlling the microstructure of complex foods is an essential reference for industry professionals and scientists concerned with improving the performance of existing food products and inventing novel food products.\r\n\r\nReviews the current understanding of significant aspects of food structure and methods for its control\r\nFocuses on the fundamental structural elements present in foods such as proteins and fats and the forces that hold them together\r\nDiscusses novel analytical techniques that provide information on the morphology and behaviour of food materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1adfb5552d0abf813864ff6dba7f59e1ec72e72","amp;dn":"Understanding+and+Controlling+the+Microstructure+of+Complex+Food","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1adfb5552d0abf813864ff6dba7f59e1ec72e72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,173,251,85,82,208,171,248,19,134,79,246,219,167,245,158,30,199,46,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
