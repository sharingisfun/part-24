Think everyone who likes Tom will def like this. They are all Ex quality and there are some great performances here as well. I esp love the MTV and Letterman that kick it off,that version of Mary Jane scalds.\r\nThis is an interesting time for the band as well,as you see the Heartbreakers lose their drummer Stan Lynch ,have Dave Grohl for one night and then pick up the permanent replacement Steve Ferrone.\r\nI've made a bunch of these for lots of different bands. We'll see what we can get too.\r\nIf anybody is interested in putting proper menus and chapters to this DVD,please feel free to do so,I'd love to see that posted.\r\nAs always huge Thanks to George for doing posting.\r\nEnjoy Everybody\r\nRich B. &quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Stonecutter and Kingrue","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97420f09297023902a6df628555883da57d10df1","amp;dn":"Tom+Petty+-+TV+1994-1996","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97420f09297023902a6df628555883da57d10df1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,66,15,9,41,112,35,144,42,109,246,40,85,88,131,218,87,209,13,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
