(Bonus Track)\t \t3:21\n\nBiography\n\nBorn and raised by his single mother in Southern Houston, Texas, Lecrae moved often in his early life living in San Diego, \n\nDenver, and Dallas. Moore discovered rapping as a musical outlet to help him convey his feelings to others. Christianity \n\ndid not enter his life until after he had graduated from high school.[5]\nWhen he was 19, a Christian leader encouraged him to attend a conference where he heard James G. White speak. Because of \n\nthis, he became passionate for Christianity. His strong religious conviction led him to print his testimony and pass it out \n\nacross the University of North Texas campus. The next five years included many struggles and victories.[citation needed]\nAfter graduating from the University of North Texas, Lecrae lived in Dallas. There he volunteered at a juvenile detention \n\ncenter and began working on his debut album. At the age of 25 he co-founded Reach Records, and released his first album, \n\ncalled Real Talk.\nLecrae co-founded ReachLife Ministries in 2005 to help reform urban culture. The non-profit organization exists to help \n\nequip local Christian leaders with tools and media projects that are culturally relevant and based on the teachings of the \n\nBible.\nLecrae now resides in Atlanta, GA with his wife and children. He continues to rap, and frequently collaborates with Reach \n\nRecords artists and the 116 Clique.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fbad001a0c7419fe2e16e5301289f201185c3e4","amp;dn":"Lecrae+-+After+The+Music+Stops+%28+Cross+Movement+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fbad001a0c7419fe2e16e5301289f201185c3e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,186,208,1,160,199,65,159,226,225,110,83,1,40,159,32,17,133,195,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
