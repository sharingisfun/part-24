Derived from live performances at the Fillmore East and at Pirate's World in Dania, FL, it is probably, in fairness, the best representation of Johnny Winter's sound from his prime years that one is likely to find -- the pity is that it's only about 40 minutes long, and is weighted very heavily toward Winter's covers of well-known rock &amp; roll numbers. Considering that it was recorded along a tour promoting the Johnny Winter And album, one would expect that the band would have done a considerable number of tracks from that record, none of which are represented here. The highlights are of considerable value, however, including a searing rendition of the Stones' &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot; sandwiched between some much older repertory (&quot;Great Balls of Fire,&quot; &quot;Long Tall Sally,&quot; &quot;Johnny B. Goode,&quot; etc.). Except for the opener, &quot;Good Morning Little School Girl,&quot; on which Winter and the band try to show how many notes they can hit as quickly as they can, the players generally try for something a little more subtle and interesting, and one wishes that more of what they did had used the slow blues groove they settle into on &quot;It's My Own Fault.&quot; Their version of &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; has some of that, mostly by default (no one did the song faster than Jerry Lee Lewis anyway), and also enough energy so one doesn't even &quot;miss&quot; the piano one usually expects somewhere in the song; &quot;Long Tall Sally,&quot; by contrast, kicks in on overdrive and takes off from there. But for all of the musical virtues (and obvious joy) that Winter and company bring to those standards, the most interesting cuts here are &quot;It's My Own Fault&quot; and Winter's own &quot;Mean Town Blues,&quot; and one wishes that there were more such tracks here. In that regard, it might be worthwhile for someone at Sony/Legacy to do a serious vault search and see if there are surviving tapes of any other numbers recorded from the two shows (and was it just two?) that were recorded for this album\n\nJohnny Winter And\nAfter two late-'60s albums on Columbia, Johnny Winter hit his stride in 1970 working with Rick Derringer and the McCoys, now recruited as his sidemen and collaborators (and proving with just about every note here how far they'd gotten past &quot;Hang on Sloopy&quot;). In place of the bluesy focus on his first two albums, Winter extended himself into more of a rock-oriented mode here, in both his singing and his selection of material. This was hard rock with a blues edge, and had a certain commercial smoothness lacking in his earlier work. Derringer's presence on guitar and as a songwriter saw to it that Winter's blues virtuosity was balanced by perfectly placed guitar hooks, and the two guitarists complemented each other perfectly throughout as well. There wasn't a weak moment anywhere on the record, and if Johnny Winter And wasn't a huge commercial success, it was mostly because of the huge amount of competition at the time from other, equally inspired players, that kept numbers like the Winter originals &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; and &quot;Guess I'll Go Away&quot; as well as Derringer co-authored pieces such as &quot;Look Up&quot; from having the impact they should have had on FM radio. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd52859fad50f9d2d8a54eadf39f947474ab1b0e","amp;dn":"Johnny+Winter%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3BAnd%2FLive+2LPs+%281976%29+VinylRip+24-96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd52859fad50f9d2d8a54eadf39f947474ab1b0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,82,133,159,173,80,249,210,216,165,78,173,243,159,148,116,116,171,27,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
