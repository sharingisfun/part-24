Comrising 11 tracks, 10 of which are covers, she displays her impeccable phrasing against a suitably muscular musical backdrop by her able backing band. \n\n&quot;The very thought of you&quot; gets a tender piano treatment with a beautiful tenor sax solo by Ira Wiggins. &quot;Theme from Valley of the dolls&quot; is lilting and lovely, while &quot;Smile&quot; (which we've all heard hundreds of versions of) is given a lightly bouncy organ/piano/bass-filled treatment with tempo changes and acceleration. \n\n&quot;Get out of town&quot; has a light Reggae lilt and some delightful scatting and is truly beautiful. &quot;Skylark&quot; is spare with some morose sounding bass, while &quot;Lift every voice and sing&quot; is given a contemporary touch courtesy of a rap (telling us the inportance of music in black history) by her son Pierce Freelon which doesn't sound out of place. \n\nThe lone original is &quot;Cell phone blues&quot;, which as its name implies is Blues with humorous lyrics incorporating cell phone jargon ( &quot;I got the sweetest network&quot;, &quot;Better pay me some attention, I just might have to roam&quot; or &quot;I'm looking for a lover, on the friends and family plan&quot; ). \n\nSparkling and splendid!  ~ Nse Ette\n\nNnenna Freelon - Homefree Tracklist:\n01  The Lamp Is Low\n02  I Feel Pretty\n03  The Very Thought Of You\n04  Theme From Valley Of The Dolls\n05  Smile\n06  You And The Night And The Music\n07  Cell Phone Blues\n08  Get Out Of Town\n09  Skylark\n10  Lift Every Voice And Sing\n11  America The Beautiful","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eff9132ef665f8ca000080ecbaaa41a73369f54","amp;dn":"Nnenna+Freelon+-+Homefree+%282010%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eff9132ef665f8ca000080ecbaaa41a73369f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,255,145,50,239,102,95,140,160,0,8,14,203,170,164,26,115,54,159,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
