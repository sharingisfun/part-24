Unfortunately this doesn't include what might be his most interesting work (on Wittgenstein).\n\n\n1. After Aquinas: Versions of Thomism (Blackwell, 2002). 254 pages. High quality pdf.\n\n2. Thomas Aquinas: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford, 2009). 127 pages. High quality pdf.\n\n3. Twentieth-Century Catholic Theologians (Blackwell, 2007). 230 pages. This is a reprocessed, improved version of an older scan. At first appearance it looks to be very good quality, but problems with the source file have resulted in minor blemishes throughout -- mostly missing punctuation. It's the best I could do, and is quite readable.\n\n\nabout the author:\n\nFergus Kerr, OP, FRSE (born 16 July 1931), a prominent scholar, widely recognized for his contributions in the areas of philosophy and theology, is a Scottish Roman Catholic priest of the English Dominican Province. He has published significantly on a wide range of subjects, but is famous particularly for his work on Ludwig Wittgenstein and Thomas Aquinas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4abe4a22a73b1c0cb3e8b1fe1d6741ea377925c9","amp;dn":"Fergus+Kerr+-+Thomist+philosopher+%283+books%29+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4abe4a22a73b1c0cb3e8b1fe1d6741ea377925c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,190,74,34,167,59,28,12,179,232,177,254,29,103,65,234,55,121,37,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
