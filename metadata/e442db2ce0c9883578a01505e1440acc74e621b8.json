Wishing to be done with the contest, Dr. Maxford (Raymond Walburn),\nthe owner of Maxford House Coffee, accepts that Jimmy is the winner and hands him the check of $25,000, without\nrealizing that the judging committee is still deliberating.\n\nJimmy is now seen as a hidden advertising talent at work, and is given a major promotion and the afternoon off.\nHe and Betty embark on a shopping spree. Purely on the basis of the check, Jimmy is given credit to buy an\nengagement ring for Betty, a luxury sofa-bed for his mother, and presents for many of the poor families that\nlive on his street.\n\nSoon the truth emerges and the shop manager descends on Jimmy's street where a carnival atmosphere of celebration\nis taking place. Dr. Maxford follows soon after.\n\nWith the truth out, Betty pleads with Jimmy's boss to let him keep his promotion. Meanwhile the judging\ncommittee at Maxford House have finally reached a decision. Unknown to them, the winning slogan is in fact\nJimmy's, and a telegram is dispatched to the winner.\n\n\nVideo Codec: XVID  (Matroska)\n(Container - V_MPEG4/ISO/ASP)\n\nFrame Size: 720 x 480  (Native Format)\nRatio: 3:2\n\nFrame Rate: 29.970 fps\nVideo Bitrate: 1024 bps\nDuration: 1:07:26\n\nAudio Codec: mp3\nAudio sample rate: 44.1 Khz\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\n\nCast:\n\n    Dick Powell as Jimmy MacDonald\n    Ellen Drew as Betty Casey\n    Raymond Walburn as Dr. Maxford\n    Alexander Carr as Mr. Shindel\n    William Demarest as Mr. Bildocker\n    Ernest Truex as Mr. J.B.
