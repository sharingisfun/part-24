You can use web development tools and technologies you already know: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this book, long-time web and mobile application developer Lee S. Barney shows you how to use the QuickConnect and PhoneGap frameworks to create secure, high-quality, modular hybrid iPhone applications.\n\n \n\nLee S. Barney walks you through the entire hybrid iPhone development process, from creating great user interfaces to compiling, deploying, and executing applications. Along the way, he introduces techniques and sample code designed to streamline development, eliminate complexity, optimize performance, and leverage all iPhoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s native capabilitiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from its accelerometer and GPS to its built-in database. Coverage includes\n\n \n\n    *\n      Using Dashcode and Xcode together to create unique, exciting hybrid iPhone applications\n    *\n      Using the QuickConnect JavaScript API to perform tasks ranging from vibrating the phone to accessing the accelerometer and GPS location data\n    *\n      Accessing native iPhone functionality using the PhoneGap JavaScript API\n    *\n      Storing, retrieving, and managing data on the iPhone, even without network access\n    *\n      Using XMLHttpRequest to access or synchronize remote data and use web services\n    *\n      Creating Google-based maps for your own app that work like those you see in the iPhoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Maps application\n\n \n\nThis book systematically lowers the barriers to iPhone development, enabling web developers to build any iPhone application they can imagine without long development cycles or steep learning curves!\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 216 pages\n# Publisher: Addison-Wesley Professional; 1 edition (July 2, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0321604164\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321604163","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78452cbd4726630ca9394ae32c9cb792ebfa5696","amp;dn":"Developing+Hybrid+Applications+for+the+iPhone%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78452cbd4726630ca9394ae32c9cb792ebfa5696","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,69,44,189,71,38,99,12,169,57,74,227,44,156,183,146,235,250,86,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
