The title track, which got quite a bit of airplay on 1993&amp;#039;s then nascent adult album alternative radio format, is one of his most brilliant songs ever. It&amp;#039;s a funny yet deceptively serious song examining the correlation between the way rock stars name their guitars after women, and the way they ritualistically destroy guitars onstage. The fact that it also has the best, catchiest chorus of Hiatt&amp;#039;s career doesn&amp;#039;t hurt, either. Hiatt is relaxed, witty, and even playful throughout, balancing folky ballads and tough roots-rockers with grace and spirit. He&amp;#039;s seemingly buoyed by his increasing fame as a songwriter of repute--Bonnie Raitt&amp;#039;s excellent version of his &quot;Thing Called Love&quot; did both of their careers a world of good--and thankfully leaves behind the turbulence of his &amp;#039;80s personal life.\n   \n   Song Title \n \n  1.
