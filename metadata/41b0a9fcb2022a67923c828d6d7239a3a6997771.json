The 1963 murder, in broad daylight in front of hundreds of witnesses, might seem to be a homicide investigatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-case scenario. Yet somehow the JFK assassination became a forensic nightmare, plagued by a controversial autopsy and, incredibly, a prime suspect murdered on live television while in police custody, before he could be tried. As a result, today millions of Americans suspect a conspiracy. Now, NOVA launches a fresh investigation into the physical evidence, using state-of-the-art forensics, including laser scanning, new ballistics tests, and a 3D digital reconstruction of the president's skull, all to try to solve the murder of the century. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cold Case JFKÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½is part of series of specials airing on PBS in November to commemorate the 50th anniversary of President John F. KennedyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41b0a9fcb2022a67923c828d6d7239a3a6997771","amp;dn":"Case+Cold+JFK+++PBS+NOVA+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41b0a9fcb2022a67923c828d6d7239a3a6997771","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,176,169,252,178,2,42,103,146,60,130,141,109,114,57,163,166,153,119,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
