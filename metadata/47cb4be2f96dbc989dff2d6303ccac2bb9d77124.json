Considering the time period, this date remains way ahead of the Latin-tinged and hard bop music that would follow. It would be difficult to assess the sextet being a step below the larger group effort, but only because it is much less Afro-Cuban. Nonetheless the unmistakable drumming of Art Blakey powers the combo through the blisteringly swinging &quot;La Villa&quot; with unison horns (Hank Mobley, tenor sax; Cecil Payne, baritone sax). The other easy swinging pieces &quot;K.D.'s Motion,&quot; &quot;Venita's Dance,&quot; and &quot;Echo of Spring/K.D.'s Car Ride&quot; display great group empathy and seem effortless, though they're not. It's the Latin-based music that really differentiates this band from all others of this era, save Dizzy Gillespie's. Payne's robust bari ignites the hip call-and-response motif of &quot;Afrodisia,&quot; while his horn in tandem with pianist Horace Silver backs the up-front horns, supplemented by trombonist J.J. Johnson, for the heated mambo-ish hard bopper &quot;Basheer's Dream.&quot; Two takes of &quot;Minor's Holiday&quot; are, curiously enough, exactly the same time at 4:24, both super cooking with Dorham's clear-as-a-bell trumpet leading the other horns, which practically act as backup singers. Percussionist Carlos &quot;Patato&quot; Valdes is the perfect spice added to this dish. The lone ballad, &quot;Lotus Flower,&quot; is remarkable in that its marked tender restraint feels on the brink of wanting to cut loose, but never does. A first-rate recording for the under-appreciated Dorham, this one should be in every collection of all true music lovers. \n~ allmusic\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nTrack List\n\n01 - Afrodisia\n02 - Lotus Flower\n03 - Minor's Holiday\n04 - Basheer's Dream\n05 - K.D.'s Motion\n06 - La Villa\n07 - Venita's Dance\n08 - Echo of Spring (aka K.D.'s Cab Ride)\n09 - Minor's Holiday (Alternate Take)\n\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nEAC log, CUE sheet included.\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nTQMP.
