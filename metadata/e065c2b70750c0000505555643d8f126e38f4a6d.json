Noah Beery, Richard Farnsworth and Marty Kay Place co-star in this memorable romantic adventure.\r\n  The first meeting between John Taylor and feisty Gail Weston is hardly promising.  So when their first drilling site turns up dry, Gail packs up and heads north.  But the lure of oil discovery is strong and soon she finds herself in partnership with John on their own wildcat well.  Amidst the breathtaking beauty of Midland, Texas, they share a unique quest...and a tender love affair.

I'll see 100 people downloading and then activity goes to zero once they all get what they want.  It's unfortunate!  But, I seed my torrents 24/7, unless I'm doing a reboot or we experience a power outage.  If you start downloading one of my posts and it comes to a halt, don't give up on it, I'll be back online as soon as 'the internet God' allows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e065c2b70750c0000505555643d8f126e38f4a6d","amp;dn":"Waltz+Across+Texas+%281982%29+Anne+Archer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e065c2b70750c0000505555643d8f126e38f4a6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,101,194,183,7,80,192,0,5,5,85,86,67,216,241,38,227,143,74,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
