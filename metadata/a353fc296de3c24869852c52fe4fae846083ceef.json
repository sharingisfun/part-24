At that time, the .NET platform was still a beta product, and in many ways, so was this book. This is not to say that the early editions of this text did not have meritÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½after all, the book was a 2002 Jolt Award finalist and it won the 2003 Referenceware Excellence Award. However, over the years that author Andrew Troelsen spent working with the common language runtime (CLR), he gained a much deeper understanding of the .NET platform and the subtleties of the C# programming language, and he feels that this fifth edition of the book is as close to a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfinal releaseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s come yet.\n\nThis new edition has been comprehensively revised and rewritten to make it accurately reflect the C# 4 language specification for the .NET 4 platform. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find new chapters covering the important concepts of dynamic lookups, named and optional arguments, Parallel LINQ (PLINQ), improved COM interop, and variance for generics.\n\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re checking out this book for the first time, do understand that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s targeted at experienced software professionals and/or graduate students of computer science (so donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect three chapters on iteration or decision constructs!). The mission of this text is to provide you with a rock-solid foundation in the C# programming language and the core aspects of the .NET platform (assemblies, remoting, Windows Forms, Web Forms, ADO.NET, XML web services, etc.). Once you digest the information presented in these 25 chapters, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be in a perfect position to apply this knowledge to your specific programming assignments, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be well equipped to explore the .NET universe on your own terms.\nWhat youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn\n\nBe the first to understand the .NET 4 platform and Visual C# 2010.\nDiscover the ins and outs of the leading .NET technology.\nLearn from an award-winning author who has been teaching the .NET world since version 1.0.\nFind complete coverage of the WPF, WCF, and WF foundations that support the core .NET platform.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a353fc296de3c24869852c52fe4fae846083ceef","amp;dn":"Troelsen+-+Pro+C%23+.NET+4+English%2BRussian%2BBonus+CD+source+samples","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a353fc296de3c24869852c52fe4fae846083ceef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,83,252,41,109,227,194,72,105,133,44,82,254,79,174,132,96,131,206,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
