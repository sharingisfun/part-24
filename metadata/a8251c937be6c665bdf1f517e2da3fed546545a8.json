Silverman, whose extensive experimental and theoretical work has helped elucidate these processes, presents a clear and engaging discussion of the role of quantum superposition in diverse quantum phenomena such as the wavelike nature of particle propagation, indistinguishability of identical particles, nonlocal interactions of correlated particles, topological effects of magnetic fields, and chiral asymmetry in nature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8251c937be6c665bdf1f517e2da3fed546545a8","amp;dn":"Quantum+Superposition+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8251c937be6c665bdf1f517e2da3fed546545a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,37,28,147,123,230,198,101,189,241,245,23,226,218,63,237,84,101,69,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
