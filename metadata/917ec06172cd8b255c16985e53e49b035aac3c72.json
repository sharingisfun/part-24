There was a great vibe happening on these sessions. Although it's a studio recording all the songs were basically live takesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ there is no fancy cover up just the raw, real truth.&quot; -Reed Foehl \n\nThe Boston Globe\n&quot;He sings like he feels every note... Each song tells a story, all of which he relates astonishingly well.&quot;\n\nDonnie Moorhouse-WRNX\n&quot;If it is the assignment of artists, authors and songwriters to make sense of our emotions, then the work of REed Foehl represents the very pinnacle of the craft.&quot;\n\nProduct Description\nReed Foehl first jumped onto the music industry radar as the lead singer of the Boulder CO based jam band, Acoustic Junction (Mercury/Capricorn).
