Most of all, Don and Phil wanted to revisit their roots in the coal mining \narea of Kentucky where their father Ike, a miner, had been a local guitar star. He too had played with \nhis coal mining brothers, in the 30s. In the moody atmosphere of Muhlenberg County, they have an emotional \nreunion with three generations of Everlys.\n\nWith contributions from master musician and producer Chet Atkins, songwriters Felice and Boudleaux Bryant \nand the legendary guitar singer and ex-coal miner, Ike's close friend Mose Rager.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ab78e89878a5f82583013425a82c55477b46e7","amp;dn":"Everly+Brothers+BBC+doc.+-+Songs+of+innocence+%26amp%3B+experience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ab78e89878a5f82583013425a82c55477b46e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,171,120,232,152,120,165,248,37,131,1,52,37,168,44,85,71,123,70,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
