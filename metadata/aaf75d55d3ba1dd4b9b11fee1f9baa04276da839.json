Rolling Stone magazine referred to the band's sonic attack as one that: &quot;Demonstrates how contemporary hard rock can still be made with imagination, precision and a majestic sense of force.&quot;\n\nNow this extraordinary live show is being released digitally by Warner Bros. Records as &quot;Mastodon Live At Brixton&quot; on December 10.
