Vaughan may have been the new news, but King was not suffering, either. He had a world-class supporting band\nand was playing as well as he ever had. In other words, the stage was set for a fiery, exciting concert and that's exactly what they delivered.\nVaughan was clearly influenced by King -- there are King licks all over his first two recorded efforts, and it was an influence\nthat stayed with him to the end -- and he was unafraid to go toe-to-toe with his idol.\nKing must have been impressed, since In Session never devolves into a mere cutting contest. Instead, each musicians spurs the other to greater heights. For aficionados of either guitarist, that means the album isn't just worth a listen -- it means that it's a record that sounds as exciting on each subsequent listen as does the first time through.\n\n\n\n\n\n01.
