I have finally found a few games I have been after for ages and seem near impossible to get from torrents. Hope you like them!\n\nGame Name [ID] [FORMAT] : Wii Agent Hugo - Hula Holiday [R3HP6Z] [WBFS]\nLanguage                : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType                    : Action Adventure\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each (i've got my uTorrent set to 500%/5.0).\nDo not just leech and run. Help others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help. Please help too.\n\nAs ever, if you like it, maybe buy a Wii game to keep the franchise going as a thank-you for this freebie! Even better, get one not listed on here, and upload for me :-)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of my 740+ of my Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeel free to search and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard). Those are just for OCD people like me who simply *must* get all the Wii games they can...\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2590feb7a540adcaabc6c3b3d9af50867903b89f","amp;dn":"Wii+Agent+Hugo+-+Hula+Holiday+%5BR3HP6Z%5D+%5BWBFS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2590feb7a540adcaabc6c3b3d9af50867903b89f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,144,254,183,165,64,173,202,171,198,195,179,217,175,80,134,121,3,184,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
