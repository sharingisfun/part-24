This movie is a real documentery about the US soldiers of the National Guard who are being send out in Iraq. In Iraq they film a year long where they go throug. They let you see anything. Battle&amp;#039;s, wounded soldiers and even dead people. Also you their families during the soldiers stay in Iraq.\n\nThere are no subtitles included and i can&amp;#039;t give you any specific information about the vid, i only can say that you can trust me that the quality of sound and video is great. It&amp;#039;s a DVD-rip and it&amp;#039;s just exelent!\n\nI&amp;#039;ve got respect for the man and women servering for not only the US army but every army which is currently involved in Iraq. They do a hell of a job. I&amp;#039;m proud there are people like this walking around there. I think it&amp;#039;s very important that everybody should see this documentery, that&amp;#039;s the reason i uploaded a torrent. You can buy it and support but also download if you don&amp;#039;t have the money.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nSkybird","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1814ccd15b9376de7ecaf70cb3979c1b676ee90b","amp;dn":"The+War+Tapes+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1814ccd15b9376de7ecaf70cb3979c1b676ee90b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,20,204,209,91,147,118,222,126,202,247,12,179,151,156,27,103,110,233,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
