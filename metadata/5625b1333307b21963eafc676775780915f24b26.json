With a pre-battle population of fifteen to twenty thousand, Musa Qala was the only significant town held by the Taliban at that time. Attacking against two thousand Taliban fighters, who were heavily dug in after occupying the town for more than nine months, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was spearheaded by Task Force 1 Fury: 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, of the 82nd Airborne Division.\n\nFor the ISAF Musa Qala was a target of immense importance; the Taliban had to be driven out and the town secured. With months of occupation to get ready, the Taliban were prepared to stand and fight. What resulted was one of the biggest and most terrible battles of the war.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nePub format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5625b1333307b21963eafc676775780915f24b26","amp;dn":"Into+the+Viper%27s+Nest%3A+The+First+Pivotal+Battle+of+the+Afghan+Wa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5625b1333307b21963eafc676775780915f24b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,37,177,51,51,7,178,25,99,234,252,103,103,117,120,9,21,242,75,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
