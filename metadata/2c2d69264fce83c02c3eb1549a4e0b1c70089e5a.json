And you can bet your bottom dollar that if they had the tech theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have used it. For his self-pressed album The Grey Wizard Am I Chris Wilson (AKA Gandalf) bounced down all of the instruments onto a Ã¢â‚¬â„¢72 Sony tape recorder. 1000 copies were made and given to friends and family, with a few being sold; and Chris never guessed his gentle/primitive folk-rock album would become a cult collectors item 30+ years on. Although the pointed hat and staff image post-Peter Jackson has taken on a different meaning, in Ã¢â‚¬â„¢72 Lord Of The Rings was a slightly obscure piece of literature that the counter-culture held close to their hearts; not something of a franchise for fantasy based toys, sticker albums, games, pyjamas and y-fronts! Much of WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s album, most obviously, focuses on the book. If you will, imagine Donovan on vocals with a wee bit of Arthur Lee circa Forever Changes stirred into your average Greenwich Village folkiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ repertoire and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re over half way there in understanding this slightly invigorating album. Once you get past the Ã¢â‚¬â€œ unintentionally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ primitive recording values, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find a most pleasant folk-rock/psych album.\n\n\nRipped at 192kbs\n\n\nTracklist\n1.
