Today heâ€™s unveiled his latest era-blurring blend, fitting the almighty Underground Kingz (UGK) to a sonic palette forged from blues giant B.B. King and his trusty six-string Lucille, aptly titled The Trill Is Gone. With his latest outing, Gazaway lights a flame in honor of the late Pimp C, realizing an unlikely, yet captivating concoction of southern slur and electric blues, joining the new and old schools with his own stew of murky organ work, expert chops and the bruising bars of one Bun B.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural offering from the project takes its name from the albumâ€™s title, The Trill Is Gone, tactfully splicing UGKâ€™s â€œOne Dayâ€ with Kingâ€™s classic 1970 cover of Roy Hawkinsâ€™ â€œThe Thrill Is Goneâ€ (his first commercial success,) dialing back the BPMs just a tad to fit the all-too-tuff verbiage of some of The Southâ€™s finest MCs. Stream Amerigo Gazawayâ€™s latest down below, and if this brilliantly blend is to your liking, peep the trailer for the album and keep your eyes on us for the next episode in this terminally trill sage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtists:.............-B B King &amp; The Underground Kingz\r\nAlbum Name:..........-The Trill Is Gone\r\nFormat:..............-MP3\r\nBitrate:.............-320kbps\r\nSize:................-167 MB\r\nTracks:..............-18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01 â€“ Pimptro\r\n02 â€“ The Trill Is Gone (feat.
