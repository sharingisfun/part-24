Action \n  DiSK(s) ....\nPROTECTiON . Steam   \n  GAME NOTES  \n  In Planet Explorers, it is the year 87, one of the first colony ships sent   out by Earth arrives at the planet Maria, in the Epsilon Indi Star System.  During its landing sequence, something appears in front of the massive ship    that causes it to lose control and crash into the planet. Some of the colonists   survive in lifeboats, but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with    creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must  explorer, gather, build, create, fight, and ultimately, build a new home. \n  KEY FEATURES \n  Planet Explorers will feature single and multiplayer modes, with a possible  level editor mode added later on.  In single player there are 3 distinct selections  \n  * Story Mode - Story mode is the main meat and bones of the game, it is the  action-adventure-rpg-somewhat-4X segment, offering npcs, missions, town  building, farming, diplomacy, and of course, a storyline that you can follow  or ignore. This story features a 17X8km world map with many unique character,  landscapes, biomes, locations, and over 100 types of potential enemies. Even  though weÃ‚â€™ve made it seem like a very action oriented game in the trailers, in reality, players can choose to not fight so much as to just plant a farm, make some food, keep the colonists alive, negotiate with the sentient aliens, and   defend the perimeter from the local life forms. That can still eventually  arrive at the ending. And yes, there is an ending. \n  * Adventure Mode - This mode is based on a procedural map generated from a seed. Currently, it comes in a 40X40 kilometer map. Players will be able to complete random missions, defeat bosses, and explore different landscapes in   the mode and eventually be able to setup conditions that they want to play  (such as tower defense or attack an alien camp).\n  * Build Mode - In this mode, there are no enemies and an infinite amount of   building material. It also currently comes in a 40X40km map. Players will be   able to build whatever they want in this mode, including everything in the  Creations Editor. Think of this as the perfect testing ground to test everything you build. OrÃ‚â€¦it's your place to build your garden without ever  worrying about the pesky aliens.   Multiplayer will allow Local Area Network and player hosted servers. It will   feature several modes but some are still on the drawing board or going through    technical trials so the final result is still in flux. Players playing   multiplayer should be able to bring at least one of their created objects into    multiplayer games, be it a sword, gun, or vehicle.\n  * Coop - Coop will come in many selections, such as adventure mode, tower  defense mode, build mode, etc. The first one to be completed will be build  mode, since itÃ‚â€™s the easiest for us to do.\n  * Versus - This mode will allow teams of up to 16 players to battle against 16   players from another team. We are going to allow full terrain manipulation in  this mode. We are going to have base defense, capture the flag, and something  similar to Clash of Clans. \n  iNSTALL NOTES\n  Extract \n  Run using Planet Explorers_PCPlay_Planet_Explorers.exe\n  Play \n  ADDiTiONAL NOTES  \n  Game version alpha 0.7 (crack pre-activates alpha release)  \n   More Info\n\n CREDiTS \n  ALI13 for cracked game files  \n GREETiNGS  \n   juchmis / friends of PPGAMES / All PP Groups / My Weed Dealer / Your MOM \n XANAX / TPTB / 3DM / ALI13 / OXY30 / MPOD / WTF / LOL / I8MUCHP1E / All...  \n  IF YOU LIKE THIS SOFTWARE, BUY IT!  \n juchmis\n  013-10-19","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b042c416cc2a21923e854364254437726b829b36","amp;dn":"Planet+Explorers+Alpha+v0+72+Cracked-P2PGAMES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b042c416cc2a21923e854364254437726b829b36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,66,196,22,204,42,33,146,62,133,67,100,37,68,55,114,107,130,155,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
