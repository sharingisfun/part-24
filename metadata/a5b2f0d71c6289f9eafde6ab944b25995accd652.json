This is how to be successful!\n\n  1. As the Boss/Owner/CEO your job is to find the best talent and pay them correctly. The top doesn't deserve all of it.\n\n  2. You make their life as easy as possible doing their job which makes you money.\nAnd you never delay or fuck up the pay schedule.\n\n  3. Anything that hinders any of the above items you STOP it IMMEDIATELY.\nA successful Co. is not about blink blink stupid kid shit. It's about people.\n\n\nIf you think business is about fuckin people over to be successful you will FAIL!\n\n\nIf you think people buy products by hijacking their browser and sending them to a BULLSHIT site to buy some product you're a MORON.\n\nThe opposite is what happens.\n\nI'm small here but I help.
