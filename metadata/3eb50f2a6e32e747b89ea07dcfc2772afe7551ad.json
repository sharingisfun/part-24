Craig Murray is Rector of the University of Dundee and an Honorary Research Fellow at the University of Lancaster. He was a member of the British diplomatic service from 1984 to 2005 and British Ambassador to Uzbekistan from 2002-2004. In 1998, Murray became Deputy Head of the Africa Department but, after a brush with mercenary commander Colonel Tim Spicer, he unwittingly created the Arms to Africa investigation. Suspended from duty and quickly dispatched to Ghana as Deputy High Commissioner, Murray next found himself caught up in dangerous negotiations with the murderous rebels of Sierra Leone. He miraculously emerged with a peace deal that would save the lives of tens of thousands, only to have his thunder stolen by Jesse Jackson. His adventures in Africa from 1997 to 2001 tell for the first time the full truth about the &quot;Arms to Africa&quot; affair which was the first major scandal of the Blair years. He lays bare the sordid facts about British mercenary involvement in Africa and its sinister motives. This is at heart an extraordinary account of Murray's work in negotiating peace with the murderous rebels of Sierra Leone, and in acting as the midwife of Ghanaian democracy. Clearly his efforts were not only difficult but at times very dangerous indeed. Yet the story is told with great humour. Not only do we meet Charles Taylor, Olusegun Obasanjo, Jerry Rawlings and Foday Sankoh, but there are unexpected encounters with others including Roger Moore, Jamie Theakston and Bobby Charlton! Above all this book is about Africa. The author eschews the banal remedies of the left and right to share with us the deep knowledge and understanding that comes over 30 years working in or with Africa. Gems of wisdom and observation scatter the book, as does a deep sense of moral outrage at the consequences of centuries of European involvement: even though he explains that much of it was well-intentioned but disastrous. The Catholic Orangemen of Togo is a rare book that presents African development issues and the complex and continuing ramifications of colonial rule that has created unbearable pressure on the local inhabitants. As the author explains, western involvement with Africa doesn't necessarly mean progress but mostly support for tyrannical rule which usually results in horrible population genocide as noone in the west has any desire to share the enormous African wealth with them. 230 pages. A must read for everyone. Note: The publication of this book was threatened by a mercenaries company and consequently the publisher decided not to print it at all so please help to spread this valuable work that exposes crimes the modern society knows so little about.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb50f2a6e32e747b89ea07dcfc2772afe7551ad","amp;dn":"Murray-Catholic+Orangemen+of+Togo%28UK+war+crimes+in+Africa%29%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb50f2a6e32e747b89ea07dcfc2772afe7551ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,181,15,42,110,50,231,71,184,158,160,125,207,194,119,42,254,117,81,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
