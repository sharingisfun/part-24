The Stones were never as consistent on album as their main rivals, the Beatles, and Let It Bleed suffers from some rather perfunctory tracks, like &quot;Monkey Man&quot; and a countrified remake of the classic &quot;Honky Tonk Woman&quot; (here titled &quot;Country Honk&quot;). Yet some of the songs are among their very best, especially &quot;Gimme Shelter,&quot; with its shimmering guitar lines and apocalyptic lyrics; the harmonica-driven &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;; the druggy party ambience of the title track; and the stunning &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want,&quot; which was The Stones' &quot;Hey Jude&quot; of sorts, with its epic structure, horns, philosophical lyrics, and swelling choral vocals. &quot;You Got the Silver&quot; (Keith Richards' first lead vocal) and Robert Johnson's &quot;Love in Vain,&quot; by contrast, were as close to the roots of acoustic down-home blues as The Stones ever got. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://musicqwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/let-it.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://musicqwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/let-it.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n01 - Gimme Shelter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:30\n02 - Love in Vain (Robert Johnson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:19\n03 - Country Honk Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:07\n04 - Live with Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:33\n05 - Let It Bleed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:27\n06 - Midnight Rambler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:52\n07 - You Got the Silver Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:50\n08 - Monkey Man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:11\n09 - You Can't Always Get What You Want Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:28","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4fab88e3da1e2559ae4a4b7ee4741151582c127","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+Let+It+Bleed+%5BFlac%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4fab88e3da1e2559ae4a4b7ee4741151582c127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,250,184,142,61,161,226,85,154,228,164,183,238,71,65,21,21,130,193,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
