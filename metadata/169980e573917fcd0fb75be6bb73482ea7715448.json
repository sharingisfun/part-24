During the first two thirds of that decade, she produced only two little\nnoticed studio albums. After a long commercial absence, she returned late in 1979 with the \nhighly acclaimed landmark album, Broken English. Faithfull's subsequent solo work, often \ncritically acclaimed, has at times been overshadowed by her personal history.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970, she had a highly publicised romantic relationship with Rolling Stones' \nlead singer, Mick Jagger. She also co-wrote &quot;Sister Morphine&quot;, which is featured on the Stones\nSticky Fingers album.\n\n\n   1. Marianne Faithfull - Broken English                        [04:38]\n   2.
