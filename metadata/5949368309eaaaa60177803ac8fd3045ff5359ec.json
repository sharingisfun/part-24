Some revisionists have tried to cast him as a sort of early blue-eyed soul figure, although he was probably more aligned with pop/rock, at first as the lead singer of the Belmonts, and then as a solo star. Drug problems slowed him down in the mid-'60s, yet he made some surprisingly interesting progressions into blues-rock and folk-rock as the decade wore on, culminating in a successful comeback in the late '60s, although he was unable to sustain its commercial and artistic momentum for long.\n\n\nWhen Dion DiMucci was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Traditional Blues category for 2006's Bronx in Blue, an excellent collection of blues standards, it was an official affirmation that he was &quot;back.&quot; In truth, he'd never left, and had been recording all along. He issued a stellar follow-up in 2007's Son of Skip James, a collection of revelatory blues covers and fine new material. The third album in this blues trilogy is Tank Full of Blues. Recorded in a trio setting, Dion produced the album, wrote all but two selections, and played the hell out of all the guitars on it. Tank Full of Blues is a slippery, street-smart, utterly inspired album of blues and roots rock tunes that are free of nostalgia and drenched in history.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Tank Full Of Blues\n02.I Read It (In The Rolling Stone)\n03.Holly Brown\n04.Ride's Blues (For Robert Johnson)\n05.Two Train\n06.Do You Love Me Baby\n07.You Keep Me Cryin'\n08.My Michelle\n09.My Baby's Cryin'\n10.I'm Ready To Go\n11.Bronx Poem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5949368309eaaaa60177803ac8fd3045ff5359ec","amp;dn":"Dion+-+Tank+Full+Of+Blues+%282012%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5949368309eaaaa60177803ac8fd3045ff5359ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,73,54,131,9,234,170,166,1,119,128,58,200,253,48,69,255,83,89,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
