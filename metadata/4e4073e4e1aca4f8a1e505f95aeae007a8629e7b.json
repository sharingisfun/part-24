When he began seeing his cherished art form co-opted by all manner of con artists, he made it his mission to expose the simple tricks charlatans have borrowed from magicians to swindle the masses.\r\n\r\nThis entertaining film chronicles Randi's best debunkings of faith healers, fortune tellers and psychics. It documents his rivalry with famed spoon-bender Uri Geller, whom Randi eventually foiled on a high-profile television appearance. Another target was evangelist Peter Popoff, whose tent-show miracles and audience mind-reading were exposed as chicanery when Randi revealed a recording of Popoff's wife feeding him information through a radio-transmitter earpiece.\r\n\r\nIn telling Randi's strange, funny and fascinating life story, the film shows how we are all vulnerable to deception - even, in a surprising twist, 'The Amazing' Randi himself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e4073e4e1aca4f8a1e505f95aeae007a8629e7b","amp;dn":"Exposed.Magicians.Psychics.and.Frauds.EN.SUB.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e4073e4e1aca4f8a1e505f95aeae007a8629e7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,64,115,228,225,172,164,248,161,229,5,249,90,234,224,7,168,98,158,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
