At the beginning of 1965, the Shanes got their big break when they toured all over Sweden, and were chased by hysterical fans. \n\nIn the Spring of 67, 4 members of the Shanes were drafted to the Swedish military. A year later, after their service, the Shanes found music to be a lot different. This lead to the breaking up of the Shanes.\n\n- - -\n\nShanes - Original Album Serien 1964-1967\n(5CD EMI Sweden 2012)\n\nCD1  Let Us Show You! 1964\nCD2  The Shanegang 1965\nCD3  Shanes Again! 1966\nCD4  SSSS Shanes! 1967\nCD5  Shanes VI 1967\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a52e417073840bd76e2e1c70bf6e9af2f36b503f","amp;dn":"Shanes+-+Original+Album+Serien+1964-1967+-+5CD-BOX+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a52e417073840bd76e2e1c70bf6e9af2f36b503f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,46,65,112,115,132,11,215,110,46,28,112,191,110,154,242,243,107,80,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
