Dirt Track Date proved to be something of a disappointment for the group&amp;#039;s hardcore fans; nearly half the album&amp;#039;s songs had appeared on previous SCOTS releases (&quot;Eight Piece Box&quot; hit plastic for the third time on this set), and while producer Mark Williams was sympathetic to the band&amp;#039;s approach, the slightly grittier, more homemade sound of For Lovers Only and Ditch Diggin&amp;#039; better suited the band&amp;#039;s Dixie-fried guitar textures than Williams&amp;#039; tidier approach. But while Williams cleaned up the band&amp;#039;s sound a bit, he didn&amp;#039;t rob Rick Miller&amp;#039;s hot-rodded guitar of its power to shake the house, and if the set list is familiar to old fans, it makes for an excellent &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; set, with the chicken-scratch R&amp;B of &quot;Soul City,&quot; the faux-exotica of &quot;Galley Slave,&quot; and the slow-turning dance groove of &quot;Camel Walk&quot; offering rockin&amp;#039; proof that there was a lot more to this band than hillbilly jokes. For Lovers Only is probably Southern Culture on the Skids&amp;#039; best album, but Dirt Track Date may well be the best place for first-time listeners to investigate the band&amp;#039;s enchantingly warped take on American roots rock.
