I cleaned it and recorded it with fairly nice\nequipment and then did a two-pass critical listen with\nheadphones on while I took out a few minor imperfections\nwith Goldwave.  I don't think you'll be distracted by a\nsingle snap or pop.  There is a low audio buzz in the right\nchannel at the start of Play Born To Lose Again that I am\nconvinced is in the vinyl.  Other than that I believe it's a\nvery nice recording.\n\nI'm going to offer it in three torrents.  The FLAC version\nis one long continuous track and has the cover and label\nscans at 300 DPI.  The MP3 version is cut into tracks\naccording to the disk labels and has the cover and label\nscans at 150 dpi.  The Wave version is for those who want to\nburn it directly to an audio CD and also includes the 150\nDPI scans.\n\nI bought this album for one song: I Can Almost See Houston\nFrom Here.  It's my all time favorite Ronnie Milsap song and\nas far as I can determine, it was never released on any\nother album.  The rest of the album is OK, in my opinion,\nexcept for Honky Tonk Women.  Besides being totally out of\nplace in this album, it didn't need covered by Ronnie Milsap\nor anyone else.\n\nWhatever.  Have fun.\n\nNeon Vincent\n20111126\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3a87e1435c5faf8f30a9a4e6f4488917136c1cd","amp;dn":"Ronnie+Milsap+Live+-+Rare+Vinyl+Rip+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3a87e1435c5faf8f30a9a4e6f4488917136c1cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,168,126,20,53,197,250,248,243,10,154,78,111,68,136,145,113,54,193,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
