Heaven Was Blue ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 18.29\n\nRick Saucedo is mainly known as an Illinois-based Elvis impersonator, and a successful one at that, but some time when the KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ghost wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t looking he sneaked out and cut himself two sides of music that were as far to the other end of the spectrum as you can imagine; dreamy, melodic 60s-style psychedelia.\n\nThe album opens with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRealityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a dreamy yet concise trip of rich guitar tapestries and nice folky hooks. It is a flowing and multilayered piece of music with wistful vocals and a droning melody.\n\nSaucedo then spins a few wheels on his kaleidoscope and via a single echoing guitar note we flow into ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn my mindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a counterpart and alternative to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRealityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of almost the exact same duration. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s at least as strong as the opening track, a little heavier with fuzz chords chugging underneath the multilayered guitars and a more cutting vocal style, albeit still totally in a 1967-68 flowerpsych mood along with the great use of organ and booming bass.\n\nSkipping past the two roots rockers, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to flip the LP over and parachute into the marvelously painted landscape that constitutes SaucedoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sidelong title track. If it seems that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn my mindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRealityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ gave promises of melodic psychedelic nirvana, then ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeaven was blueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the realization. Clocking in at almost 19 minutes it is something unique in the psychedelic world; a successful transportation of the acid heritage from John LennonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRevolverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ into the domains of carefully composed suites. Saucedo pulls it off like a charm ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ stacking new melodies, guitar figures and arrangements atop the old ones every 3 minutes or so, each more swirling and enchanting than the last, and retaining a sense of progression throughout. The fact that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s less than a perfect performance, with guitars occasionally strolling off-key and the drummer seeming to wing it as he goes along, enforces the human warmth and removes any progressive rock specter forcefully.\n\nExactly how a moonlighting Elvis impersonator made this amazing album is one for our childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s children to ponder.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n[url] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/[/url]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/[/url]&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3cf408350b3c15b24736a988acd95a3b1797c75","amp;dn":"Rick+Saucedo...Heaven+Was+Blue%281978%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3cf408350b3c15b24736a988acd95a3b1797c75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,207,64,131,80,179,193,91,36,115,106,152,138,205,149,163,177,121,124,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
