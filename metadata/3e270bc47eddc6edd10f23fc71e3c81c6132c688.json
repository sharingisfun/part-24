It fully automates the process of entering passwords and other data into websites and saves the user going to the trouble of creating and remembering multiple passwords. When you use Kaspersky Password Manager to log in, you can rest assured that your data is safe. The software creates exceptionally strong passwords and prevents your login information from being stolen. All confidential data is encrypted and kept in a dedicated database on your computer. Kaspersky Password Manager makes your web experience safer, quicker and more convenient.\n\nMain Features\n\n* Sign-in with a single click of the mouse\nKaspersky Password Manager remembers your usernames and their associated passwords so that when you return to a site it will provide your login data automatically. Kaspersky Password Manager also works with applications that require authentication.\n\n* Reliable protection for your passwords\nKaspersky Password Manager securely stores your passwords and personal data in a dedicated, encrypted database on your computer. The stored passwords can only be deciphered by the use of a master password or another authentication method defined by the user. This ensures that your passwords are secure and prevents criminals from stealing them.\n\n* Supports various methods of authentication\nKaspersky Password Manager helps you to control access to your password database with a master password or by using a USB or Bluetooth device. You can even use your mobile phone: your passwords can be configured so that they are only available when your mobile phone is connected to your computer via Bluetooth. If you leave your computer and take your phone with you, the database will automatically lock itself.\n\n* Generation of strong passwords\nThe security of your data depends directly on how strong your passwords are. Users often have similar or identical passwords for multiple accounts. By cracking a single password, a cybercriminal can easily gain access to many accounts. The password generator integrated into Kaspersky Password Manager will create strong passwords for you that are extremely difficult to crack.\n\n* Import passwords from other operating systems and applications\nWith Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, passwords are stored in an unprotected format and can easily be accessed by cybercriminals. Kaspersky Password Manager helps you to locate these unprotected passwords and import them into the encrypted password database.\n\n* Mobile version\nKaspersky Password ManagerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mobile version provides access to your passwords while working on any computer, without having to install a thing. The mobile version can be launched from different types of mobile devices, including flash drives. If the device is then removed, Kaspersky Password Manager locks the password database automatically and removes any trace of your password data from the host machine.\n\n* Automatically completes lengthy forms\nWebsite forms often require the entry of personal information over and above that of username and password. Such additional data may include: your full name, date of birth, xxx, email address, phone number, country of residence, etc. Kaspersky Password Manager can automatically fill in these kinds of forms for you, using information that you provide beforehand. Several ID cards can be used to store business-related and personal information separately.\n\n* Several usernames for a single account provider\nSometimes, several passwords must be stored for a single website. For example, you may have several mailboxes, each with a different purpose, registered with a single mail service provider. Kaspersky Password Manager can store several usernames for a single provider and check which one you want to use when you sign in.\n\n* Automatic backup\nKaspersky Password Manager automatically creates a backup copy of your password database on your computer each time it is modified. You can easily restore your passwords if the current database is accidentally damaged, or if you want to roll back to a previous version.\n\n* Effective protection against keyloggers\nA keylogger is a malicious program that tracks keystrokes on the victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s computer to illegally capture the userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal data, such as passwords. Kaspersky Password Manager enters passwords without actually using the keyboard and so effectively protects your personal data from keyloggers.\n\n* Protection from phishing attacks\nPhishing is a type of hostile activity whereby a cybercriminal invites the user to visit a website in order to trick the user into divulging their account information. The fake site looks identical to the original site and an unwitting user consequently supplies their personal data. Kaspersky Password Manager effectively counters phishing attacks by checking if the URL is authentic and if your software is up-to-date.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOperating Systems\n\nMicrosoft Windows XP Home Edition\nMicrosoft Windows XP Professional\nMicrosoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition\nMicrosoft Windows Vista Home Basic (32/64 bit)\nMicrosoft Windows Vista Home Premium (32/64 bit)\nMicrosoft Windows Vista Business (32/64 bit)\nMicrosoft Windows Vista Enterprise (32/64 bit)\nMicrosoft Windows Vista Ultimate (32/64 bit)\nMicrosoft Windows 7 Home Premium (32/64 bit)\nMicrosoft Windows 7 Professional (32/64 bit)\nMicrosoft Windows 7 Ultimate (32/64 bit)\nWindows 8 (32/64 bit)\nWindows 8 Pro (32/64 bit)\nWindows 8 Enterprise (32/64 bit)\n\n\nHomepage: http://www.kaspersky.com/password-manager\n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\n- Install program.\n- Register application with given Key.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e270bc47eddc6edd10f23fc71e3c81c6132c688","amp;dn":"Kaspersky+Password+Manager+v5.0.0.178+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e270bc47eddc6edd10f23fc71e3c81c6132c688","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,39,11,196,126,221,198,237,209,15,35,252,113,227,200,28,97,50,198,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
