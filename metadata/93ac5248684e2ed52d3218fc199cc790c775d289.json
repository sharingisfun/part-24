Take a listen, I promise you won't be disappointed if you like Alt Rock.\n\nFrom Magnatune:\nImmune is the marching band to either the apocalypse or redemption- take your pick. To them it might be the same thing. But whether heaven or hell is their destination of choice, they'll make the trip with churning choruses, anger and wit, a split screen of empathy and defiance. And did I say we could all merrily sing along?\nImmune was crystallized in Providence, Rhode Island by songwriter Rob Shulze, escaping to that non-descript wannabe metropolis from a childhood so soaked with trauma that any description would sound like an overwrought Lifetime TV mini-series. A musical scream in forlorn Rhode Island would be lost in the din of a passing Amtrak train, so Los Angeles seemed a better setting where broken dreams trump no dreams at all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93ac5248684e2ed52d3218fc199cc790c775d289","amp;dn":"Immune+-+Nothing+Left+To+Believe+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93ac5248684e2ed52d3218fc199cc790c775d289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,172,82,72,104,78,46,213,45,50,24,252,25,156,199,144,199,117,210,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
