The title track, of course, is the old Woody Guthrie song, performed with sly good humour; there's the traditional song, Miller's Pond; love songs that are loving, bitter and blue and social commentary of the highest order. The standout track is 'Sonny George', a country ballad on a tragic theme with a big tune and glorious resonator guitar; flirting knowingly with cheesiness but falling comfortably on the right side. 'Let There Be Love Tonight', another gloriously irresistible tune, has you checking that it's not a Bob Dylan (early 70's version) song that you've overlooked. Phil Lee and his producer Richard Bennett (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dire StraightsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Neil DiamondÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Notorious Cherry BombsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ) know this, too, and tease you with everything from his vocal style to the organ sound. It put a big smile on my face and who cares how close to pastiche it is? Dylan's done it to enough people, after all. In fact, there's references all over this album to musical heroes, including a Phil Lee as Tom Petty photo on the back cover, and I love it all, it's done with such affection and panache. Playing and production is shared amongst a bunch of familiar Nashville Good Guys, George Bradfute to the fore. The relaxed, joyful playing is recognisable from the work of Paul Burch and the WPA Ballclub. Paul Burch is a guest player on this record but George Bradfute seems to be the major common factor, so three cheers for George with Mr Bennett providing Guitars of course.\n\nI can't really recommend 'So Long...' highly enough. It sounds like an old friend when you first put it on and as time goes on, it just becomes an even better loved old friend.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81d8cf60511b2a851939c2e4cf329a2d24686b2d","amp;dn":"Phil+Lee+-+So+Long%2C+It%27s+Been+Good+To+Know+You+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81d8cf60511b2a851939c2e4cf329a2d24686b2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,216,207,96,81,27,42,133,25,57,194,228,207,50,154,45,36,104,107,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
