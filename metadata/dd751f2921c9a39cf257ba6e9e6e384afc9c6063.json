Now Havil is back with Impossible?, another marvelous medley of the utterly confusing, profound, and unbelievable--and all of it mathematically irrefutable.\n\nWhenever Forty-second Street in New York is temporarily closed, traffic doesn't gridlock but flows more smoothly--why is that? Or consider that cities that build new roads can experience dramatic increases in traffic congestion--how is this possible? What does the game show Let's Make A Deal reveal about the unexpected hazards of decision-making? What can the game of cricket teach us about the surprising behavior of the law of averages? These are some of the counterintuitive mathematical occurrences that readers encounter in Impossible?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd751f2921c9a39cf257ba6e9e6e384afc9c6063","amp;dn":"Impossible%3F%3A+Surprising+Solutions+to+Counterintuitive+Conundrums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd751f2921c9a39cf257ba6e9e6e384afc9c6063","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,117,31,41,33,201,163,156,242,87,186,110,158,110,56,74,252,156,96,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
