In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.\n\n\n\n\nSTARS.........: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall\nDIRECTOR......: Francis Ford Coppola\nWRITERS.......: Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo\nGENRE.........: Crime | Drama\nRATING........: 9.1/10  671,192 votes\nMETASCORE.....: 80/100\nIMDB LINK.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562\nRUNTIME.......: 3h 22mn\nSIZE..........: 6.84 GiB\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;773f1e101f37435947&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;)\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\nBITRATE.......: 4000 Kbps (3-Pass)\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\nAUDIO1........: English DTS 5.1 768kbps\nAUDIO2........: Director Commentary\nSOURCE........: Th3.G0df2th3r.Part.II.1974.1080p.BluRay.AVC.TRUEHD.5.1.IN.Fla)v(eS\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\nENCODE DATE...: 2015-05-22\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img633/7519/lGuk61.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img633/7519/lGuk61.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img912/6372/MwSuSq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img912/6372/MwSuSq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img673/9443/OuT0Bc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img673/9443/OuT0Bc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18630056724d4c96ee09b2f0fdd19671689df60c","amp;dn":"The.Godfather.II.1974.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18630056724d4c96ee09b2f0fdd19671689df60c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,99,0,86,114,77,76,150,238,9,178,240,253,209,150,113,104,157,246,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
