With courage and caution, Pete slowly earns a measure of trust from this paranoid survivalist itching for a final conflict that will signal the coming End Times.\n\nBut as Pete's own family spins out of control, Pearl's activities spark the full-blown interest of the FBI, putting Pete at the center of a massive manhunt from which no one will emerge unscathed.\n\nIn this shattering and iconic American novel, Smith Henderson explores the complexities of freedom, community, grace, suspicion, and anarchy, brilliantly depicting our nation's disquieting and violent contradictions. Fourth of July Creek is an unforgettable, unflinching debut that marks the arrival of a major literary talent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32f3a61306ef15844daaf7a4f7f0f34ae67c94f6","amp;dn":"Smith+Henderson+-+Fourth+of+July+Creek+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32f3a61306ef15844daaf7a4f7f0f34ae67c94f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,243,166,19,6,239,21,132,77,170,247,164,247,240,243,74,230,124,148,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
