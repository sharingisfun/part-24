S. Solodovnikov.\n\nThe book tells about the relation of systems of linear\ninequalities to convex polyhedra, gives a description of the\nset of all solutions of a system of linear inequalities,\nanalyses the questions of compatibility and\nincompatibilityl; finally, it gives an insight into linear\nprogramming as one of the topics in the theory of\nsystems of linear inequalities. The last section but one\ngives a proof of duality theorem of lienar programming.\nThe book is intended for senior pupils and all amateur\nmathematicians.\n\n The book was translated the Russian by Vladimir Shokurov and was\n  first published by Mir in 1979.\n\n  PDF | Cover | Bookmarks | OCR | 7.3MB | 130 pp | 600 dpi\n\n  \nReleased on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\n\nContents\n\n1.
