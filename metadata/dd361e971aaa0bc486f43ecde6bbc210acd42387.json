Big Pharma sucks.\n \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA World Without Cancer - The Story Of Vitamin B17 by G. Edward Griffin:\nMore people are making a living from cancer than dying from cancer!  Learn about the history, cause and cures they do not want your to know.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHealing Cancer with Cannabis:\nThis documentary is the first part of a three part mini series about Rick Simpson created by filmmaker Chris Harrigan. Rick is a man from Maccan that claims he has cured over 5000 people of different illness' including cancer using the concentrated extract from the cannabis plant.\n\nThe story really begins in 1969 when Rick SimpsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 22-year-old cousin was diagnosed with cancer. The doctors did an operation, and then afterwards they give him chemo. He dropped from 200 pounds down to 120 pounds. Three years later, in 1972, he came home on vacation. They were talking one day and he collapsed right in front of Simpson. He suspected it was probably the cancer back, but he was hoping it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. As soon as he went in to seeing the doctors, they just said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got three to six months to live.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½...\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'Monsanto wants total control, covers up grave GMO dangers':\nResearcher exposes Monsanto's GMO problem.  Supermarkets are flooded with GMO products, but how safe is it to eat them? Tasty and beautiful, they are produced with intervention unprecedented in history. Gene manipulation: how appropriate is it? Does it contribute to solving the food crisis on the planet? Or will humanity have to pay a costly price for meddling with what is not theirs. We talk to Jeffrey M. Smith, GMO researcher from the Institute for Responsible Technology.  A large number of case studies show that MD's who prescribe non-GMO products to patients' diets have documented a tremendous decrease in various diseases, cancers and etc.!  (That alone should be cause of concern.)\n\nMonsanto GMO uses the new and improved FAKE SCIENCE to intentionally mislead the public and achieve their goal of global dominance and servitude. Simply utilizing proven concepts in the deceptive tactics of corporate scientific authorship learned from the Drug and Tabacco (Cigarette) Companies of the past, Monsanto increases agricultural dependence and public indocrintation. Money buys Congress and the Court Legislative System to help impose and sustain their monopoly - just as Cigarette Companies did from the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's. While other nations, like in the UK, have banned all GMO products, the United States remains obedient and submissive to the Corporate Giant and helps censor the devasting consequences of using GMO products form public awareness.\n\nHowever unlike cigarettes, GMO poisoning is genetically passed onto the genes of our children; this is where the real problem arises. Not one of simply poisoning those in the present, but all future generations which inherit and compound the GMO mutations from their parents as they grow and will more likely cause irreversible damage in the form of much greater increase in cancers, diseases, and deformities. Nowadays after decades of overt deception, Tobacco is widely known among the public to cause cancer and other problems. How long is it going to take the public to wise up to the Monsanto GMO problem and at what cost to them and their loved ones?  The choice is yours, not one for just yourself, but all future generations!  So choose wisely and stand up against the GMO problem!!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNutrition &amp; Behavior, Dangers of Aspartame MSG with Dr. Russell Blaylock:\nIn this lecture, Dr. Russell Blaylock explains one of the most important connections between nutrition and our health, how nutrition affects our behavior, and the detrimental effects of excitotoxins Aspartame and MSG. Citing a series of important studies, Dr. Blaylock shows that good nutrition can powerfully enhance our memory, mood, and behavior in a socially desirable way. Like wise he shows us that poor nutrition can lead our youth into a world of violence, crime, depression and suicide.\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
