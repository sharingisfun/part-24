After living and writing songs in Nashville in the sixties with John Hiatt, he released a solo record in 1972 on the legendary Vanguard Records and shared the stage with Tim Buckley, and Townes Van Zandt. He affiliation with the label was short lived after an outspoken Frank dissed label boss Seymour Solomon at a NY publicity show and that was that and he quit music. Thirty years later he produced a second album produced by the aforementioned Dickinson and a greatly missed performer was once again back on the scene. \n\nHalf the age of Frank, John Murry, born in Tupelo, Mississippi is a direct descendent of William Faulkner. He has been a longtime member of The Dillingers and Lucero and has just recorded a Waylon Jennings tribute album with Chuck Prophet. \n\n01. Little Wiley Harpe, 1803  \n02.
