Amateur photographer Makoto (Tamaki Hiroshi) and the homely but ??\n?? endearing Shizuru (Miyazaki Aoi) meet during university ??\n?? orientation and become instant friends.

Heavenly Forest exceeds expectations in no small part due to the genuine chemistry between its two leads, both of whom deliver fine performances in their own right. Aoi Miyazaki fans will not be disappointed. \n\nReview\nby Sanjuro: At a glance, Heavenly Forest falls into the tradition of the exceedingly formulaic &quot;Pure Love&quot; subgenre that has become increasingly popular in both Japan and South Korea in recent years. A select few of these films have been both brilliant and deeply moving, while the rest are more often than not rote, unaffecting exercises in commercial filmmaking. What is perhaps most remarkable about Heavenly Forest, then, is that despite whatever clichÃƒÂ©s it may contain (and it contains many), the film&amp;#039;s central romance never feels contrived or overly-manipulative. In fact, as audience members, we don&amp;#039;t realize just how invested we are in that relationship until the delivery of an abrupt wake-up call that most viewers may not fully anticipate.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0fcd1a6127aa0c1fcd29055ee89bd739639a733","amp;dn":"Heavenly+Forest.2006%5BJap.+Eng+subs%5D%7BBest+Romantic+Movie%5D+%5BShare+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0fcd1a6127aa0c1fcd29055ee89bd739639a733","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,252,209,166,18,122,160,193,252,210,144,85,238,137,189,115,150,57,167,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
