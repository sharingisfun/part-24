Their movies - intense, dark humored and down to earth - were consistent with a radical belief that film in Romania could break through artistically. Responding to the hectic and sometimes chaotic post-Communist landscape, they took simple life stories and urban fables, and turned them into globally affecting films.\n\n\n\nBroadly acclaimed by the international film press, and stubbornly productive despite a lack of resources, these young directors were regarded at first with disdain by Romanian critics. Yet slowly but surely they gained legitimacy, winning awards at Cannes and other major film festivals, and in the process putting Romanian cinema on the world map.\n\n\n\nThe films in this special series all come from this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnew waveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of Romanian filmmakers. Few of them have had any theatrical exposure in the U.S., and through Cinemondo will reach a nationwide TV audience for the first time. Among the many highlights are Cristi PuiuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Stuff and Dough, PorumboiuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 12:08 East of Bucharest, MunteanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Paper Will Be Blue, and NemescuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ;; Marilena From P7. Because documentary filmmaking has flourished alongside fictional films in Romania, three outstanding works are included in the series: Bar de Zi, Cold Waves and Testimony.\n\n\n\nThe Romanian New Wave series is a joint project of Link TV and the Romanian Cultural Institute in New York, which arranged for these gems of world cinema to appear on Cinemondo and reach millions of American homes.
