This one desperate action of her youth shadows her throughout her life, changing it in ways she could never imagine.\nUnmarriageable, and too poor to join a convent, Louise enters the court of the Sun King as a maid of honor, where the King is captivated by her athleticism and her striking grace. As their love unfolds, Louise bears Louis four children, is made a duchess, and reigns unrivaled as his official mistress until dangerous intrigue threatens her position at court, her place in Louis's heart, and even her life. Louise must decide where she can best find the peace and fulfillment her souls has longed for, and which she has traveled so far to find.\nA riveting love story with a captivating mystery at its heart, Mistress of the Sun resurrects a fascinating female figure from the shadows of history and illuminates both the power of true and perfect love and the rash actions we take to capture and tame it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66b5cec636f655714ffb5ea89a9aec846ce9fad1","amp;dn":"Mistress+of+The+Sun+-+Sandra+Gulland.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66b5cec636f655714ffb5ea89a9aec846ce9fad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,181,206,198,54,246,85,113,79,251,94,168,154,154,236,132,108,233,250,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
