These loose, Cliffie Stone-produced broadcasts capture Merle at his most relaxed and musically imaginative. His version of &quot;Cannonball Rag,&quot; which features a bridge not found on the better-known Capitol version, is absolutely mind-boggling in its effortless technique, while his coughing spurt in the middle of a duet with wife Tex Ann is loaded with simplistic charm. In between the solo guitar pieces are a great a cappella &quot;Churchy Time,&quot; some of the early band hits like &quot;Divorce Me C.O.D.,&quot; and the trial run (from The Grand Ole Opry) of &quot;When My Baby Double Talks to Me.&quot; Transfer quality varies wildly, but nothing sounds horrible, and the performances are worth every nick and pop. A marvelous collection.\n\n    -- Cub Koda\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe704ed130a7d4a09ea025812bdb1f432bf3bee4","amp;dn":"Merle+Travis+-+Unissued+Radio+Shows+1944-1948","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe704ed130a7d4a09ea025812bdb1f432bf3bee4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,112,78,209,48,167,212,160,158,160,37,129,43,219,31,67,43,243,190,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
