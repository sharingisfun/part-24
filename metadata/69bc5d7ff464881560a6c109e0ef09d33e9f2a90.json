I'm not sure about the 'for girls' part, but this is the album that's come closest to being dance music.\nUlysses kicks things off in stunning fashion, with Alex's whispered vocals giving the track a great sound, before blasting into it's 'la la la la' chorus\nOther highlights include Turn It On - another disco infused song. No You Girls which is just too catchy for it's own good, and in my opinion, should be the next single. Live Alone is another sure fire single that's chorus will remain lodged in your head. And then comes Lucid Dreams. Many of you will have heard the pre-release of this song, and for those of you hoping for it to be slightly better produced, if that, think again. It's been totally re-worked into a total indie trance tune, and it's spectacular. It's also now doubled in length to just under eight minutes, the final four minutes being a pure acid trance instrumental of epic proportions. The albums masterpiece without a doubt\nSo why doesn't this album get five stars? There are some songs, namely Send Him Away, Can't Stop Feeling and Dream Again that lack a certain something. Good songs, but just don't hold your attention like the rest of the album. And Katherin Kiss Me may be a little too close to Eleanor Put Your Boots on for some people.\nNon the less, this is a brilliant album, that has it's sights set on a firm path, and destroys that path as it takes it\n\n   1.
