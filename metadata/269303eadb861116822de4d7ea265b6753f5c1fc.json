Various factors necessitated slight changes to the naming\n              scheme, which is why I consolidated everything into a single archive\n              this time around, instead of using the usual incremental approach.\n\nFORMATTING:   I drastically shortened and systematized the filenames, which now\n              consist of four snippets (aka &quot;tokens&quot;), separated by underscores.\n\n              Example (Weekly):    tpb.07696241_2012.09.26_HL.03.R1_T-X.torrent\n              Example (Monthly):   tpb.07743121_2012.10.00_HL.02.R2_A-Z.torrent\n              Example (Annual):    tpb.09450218_2013.00.00_0D.01.R1_9-Z.torrent\n\n   Token 1)   Torrent identifier. I put this on the left to achieve chronological\n              order; can be used to directly construct TPB/KAT upload page URLs.\n   Token 2)   Date per torrent name. Ordinary dates refer to Weeklies, while those\n              with a 00 in the day/month positions refer to the Monthlies/Annuals.\n   Token 3)   Type of torrent. In order, 0D(ay) or H(it)L(ist), part number, and\n              revision (1 for regulars, 2 for fixes, repacks, fillers, et cetera).\n   Token 4)   Initial letters of first and last files listed in the .torrent file.\n              Occasionally meaningless when a torrent was ordered by filesize.\n\nNOTE:         The first and last tokens are derived directly from the torrent\n              contents, whereas the ones in the middle are based on the original\n              torrent names, deliberately preserving any mistakes made in those","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:269303eadb861116822de4d7ea265b6753f5c1fc","amp;dn":"ComicPirates+Weeklies+Archive+%28CPWA%29+%282012-04+-+2014-12%29+%28N%3D645%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"269303eadb861116822de4d7ea265b6753f5c1fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,147,3,234,219,134,17,22,130,45,228,215,234,38,91,103,83,245,193,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
