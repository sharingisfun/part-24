The Carpenters were the #1 selling American music act of the 1970s. Though often referred to by the public as\n&quot;The Carpenters&quot;, the duo's official name on authorized recordings and press materials is simply &quot;Carpenters&quot;, without the definite article. During a period in the 1970s when louder and wilder rock was in great demand, Richard and Karen produced a distinctively soft musical style that made them among the best-selling music artists of all time. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carpenters&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carpenters&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSingles 1969-1981 - Carpenters\n1999\n\n01  Carpenters - For All We Know\n02  Carpenters - I Believe You\n03  Carpenters - It's Going To Take Some Time\n04  Carpenters - We've Only Just Begun\n05  Carpenters - Those Good Old Dreams\n06  Carpenters - Superstar\n07  Carpenters - Rainy Days And Mondays\n08  Carpenters - Goodbye To Love\n09  Carpenters - All You Get From Love Is A Love Song\n10  Carpenters - Top Of The World\n11  Carpenters - Only Yesterday\n12  Carpenters - Ticket To Ride\n13  Carpenters - Hurting Each Other\n14  Carpenters - Yesterday Once More\n15  Carpenters - Sing\n16  Carpenters - Touch Me When We're Dancing\n17  Carpenters - Please Mr. Postman\n18  Carpenters - I Need To Be In Love\n19  Carpenters - I Won't Last A Day Without You\n20  Carpenters - (They Long To Be) Close To You\n21  Carpenters - For All We Know - Reprise\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singles:_1969-1981&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singles:_1969-1981&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0nfwxq9kldke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0nfwxq9kldke&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98e4247f1dc21a77e3de63213d06a6a820d106cf","amp;dn":"Carpenters+-+Singles+1969-1981+%5B1999%5D++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98e4247f1dc21a77e3de63213d06a6a820d106cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,228,36,127,29,194,26,119,227,222,99,33,61,6,166,168,32,209,6,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
