If done by an installer, custom speakers can run to thousands of dollars and your satisfaction isn't necessarily guaranteed. The best solution is to build your own. Car Stereo Speaker Projects Illustrated, by Dan Ferguson, is the one and only illustrated project book that will take you step-by-step through the design and installation of your own customized car speakers, with minimum tools and equipment. You get 20 complete projects covering both front and rear speakers for sedans, pickups, vans, Jeeps, and SVUs. Many of the designs appear nowhere else--and virtually all have tested in use and found to be significant improvements over conventional wisdom. Each project takes you from the circuit schematic to the construction of the enclosure to installing the system in the vehicle.
