You can get this for free from the iTunes store in Podcasts, however it will not have split tracks.\n\nFor I and everyone else's conquest for knowledge on new music, uh... well what I meant to say is that this should be under fair use.\n\nReally liking the songs in this episode.\n\nPlease help me seed if you have a service provider that does not count uploads. I have a computer rigged as a dedicated server and hopefully later I can have one in a different network setup but I don't want to get money involved in this at all so seedboxes are out of the question.\n\nThanks to 1001tracklists.com for the tracklist, and Afrojack for a very good episode this week!\n\nenjoy\n\n~impetuousbrahh\n\nAfrojack - Jacked Radio 106 (Week 45) 2013-11-09\n\n01.
