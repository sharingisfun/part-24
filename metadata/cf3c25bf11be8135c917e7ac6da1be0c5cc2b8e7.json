In each episode there are four celebrity bakers facing three challenges set by Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, each hoping to win the Sport Relief Star Baker apron. This time the tent has four different hosts to coax the bakers through their challenges: Sue Perkins hands over the baton to Jo Brand, then to Omid Djalili and finally Ed Byrne.\n\n\n\n\nThe Great Sport Relief Bake Off - Series 2, Episode 1\n\n\nSue Perkins hosts the first episode, in which cricketer Michael Vaughan, James Bond and Downton Abbey actress Samantha Bond, Harry Potter actress Bonnie Wright and broadcaster Johnny Vaughan enter the tent. For the signature challenge they must make sandwich biscuits, for the technical challenge a tarte tatin and for the showstopper a 3D novelty cake, which must represent a sporting landmark.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 13-Jan-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf3c25bf11be8135c917e7ac6da1be0c5cc2b8e7","amp;dn":"The.Great.Sport.Relief.Bake.Off.S02E01.PDTV.x264-JIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf3c25bf11be8135c917e7ac6da1be0c5cc2b8e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,60,37,191,17,190,129,53,201,23,231,172,109,161,190,12,92,194,184,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
