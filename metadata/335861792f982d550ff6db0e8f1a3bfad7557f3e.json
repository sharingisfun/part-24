We will start the course by looking at the history and use cases of WebGL, and then move on to meshes, loading models, lighting, materials, texture mapping, scene interaction, and how to integrate a physics engine into your applications. The course will wrap up by putting everything you have learned together to create a 3d version of the classic game, Frogger.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:335861792f982d550ff6db0e8f1a3bfad7557f3e","amp;dn":"Pluralsight+-+WebGL+and+Three.js+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"335861792f982d550ff6db0e8f1a3bfad7557f3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,88,97,121,47,152,45,85,15,246,219,14,143,26,59,250,215,85,127,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
