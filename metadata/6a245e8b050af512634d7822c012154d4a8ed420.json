Having previously collaborated to score short films, Elara and Nova looked to advance their musical endeavors by relocating two thousand miles from their homes in California to join friend and music producer, Stephen Adwell in Texas. Together they formed Southerland Nights and quickly gained a loyal following, known as The Accolade, establishing a revolutionary relationship between the band and its listeners. The group strives to create provocative art that immediately captures the attention of their listeners and encourages inspired thought. The band's sound is a combination of energetic rock music with emotional heartfelt lyrics. Their debut EP Ã¢â‚¬Å“Destroy Something BeautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is set to be released in October of 2013.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a245e8b050af512634d7822c012154d4a8ed420","amp;dn":"Southerland+Nights+-+Destroy+Something+Beautiful+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a245e8b050af512634d7822c012154d4a8ed420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,36,94,139,5,10,245,18,99,77,120,34,192,18,21,77,74,142,212,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
