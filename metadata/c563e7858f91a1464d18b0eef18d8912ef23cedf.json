I don&amp;#039;t know why ? we knew we were up for it. We were backstage at the time, going over the lines we had to read to make a presentation to Emmylou [Harris], and Julie was actually on her way up to go tothe bathroom,&quot; he laughs. Then I said, &quot;You better wait just a second,&quot; because we were up for this. &quot;You&amp;#039;ll want to hear who won.&quot; We thought, you know, Gillian [Welch] and David [Rawlings] ? we&amp;#039;re huge fans of theirs, and I guess, maybe, assumed they were going to we. We would have voted for them if we could have voted.&quot; \n\nIf you listen to alt.country at all, though, it doesn&amp;#039;t take much to see why the Millers won or their artistry at work, defined, in part, by a questioning spiritual/secular duality. (They&amp;#039;ve been married since 1981 though they&amp;#039;ve played together since the mid-&amp;#039;70s when they met in an Austin band, Rick Stein and the Alleycats.) Buddy is a respected musician and producer ? that&amp;#039;s him playing in Emmylou Harris&amp;#039; Spyboy band, working with Steve Earle, Lucinda Williams, and Patty Griffin (among others), and producing artists like Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Vigilantes of Love. Julie&amp;#039;s songs have been covered by a range of musicians, including Harris, the Dixie Chicks, and Lee Ann Womack.
