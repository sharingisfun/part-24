It tells that there is no contradiction between Islam and true Christianity. True Christianity, in fact,leads to Islam.\nThe whole purpose of this booklet is to promote better understanding, closerrelationship, peace, and harmony between Muslims and Christians.\n\nJesus said:\n&quot;Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is expedient for you that I go awayÃÂ¾ for if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto youÃÂ¾\nbut if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of\njudgment ... I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\n\n&quot;Howbeit when he, the spirit of truth is come, he will guide you unto all truth: for he shall not speak of himselfÃÂ¾ but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.\n&quot;He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you&quot;. (John 16:715)\n\nThis prophecy applies to the Holy Prophet Muhammad, to whom was revealed the Holy Quran, which is a perfect book, and thus the Prophet Muhammad guided the people unto all truth.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n101 Question which every right minded &amp; Truth seeking Christian needs to think and ponder about, questions such as:\n\nIf Jesus's mission was to the lost sheep of Israel, why was it confined to Palestine where only two of the original tribes had settled? Did that mean that Jesus had failed in his mission? \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam. Founded in 1889, it spans over 206 countries with membership exceeding tens of millions. Its current headquarters are in the United Kingdom.\n\nAhmadiyya Muslim Community is the only Islamic organization to believe that the long-awaited Messiah has come in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) (1835-1908) of Qadian. Ahmad(as) claimed to be the metaphorical second coming of Jesus(as) of Nazareth and the divine guide, whose advent was foretold by the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad(sa).\n\nContact for more details:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOfficial websites:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b73e24d24097a9907fcdd126c6e0a1690a463581","amp;dn":"101+Questions+about+Christianity+-+True+Christianity+leads+to%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b73e24d24097a9907fcdd126c6e0a1690a463581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,62,36,210,64,151,169,144,127,205,209,38,198,224,161,105,10,70,53,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
