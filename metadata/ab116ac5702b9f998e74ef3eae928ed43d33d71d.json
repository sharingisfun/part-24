It was recorded first by Robert Gordon during 1978, and he received some modest album-oriented rock radio broadcasting with it. It was then recorded and released by The Pointer Sisters later during 1978, and they gained a major success from it, scoring a number two hit during early-February 1979 on the U.S. pop chart, and also peaking at number fifteen on the soul chart.\n\nAlthough he performed the song live from his 1978 tour onwards, Springsteen himself did not release his own recording of the song until his 1986 Live/1975-85 album, which contains his (heavily edited, to eliminate on-stage hijinks) December 16, 1978 performance. This version was released as a single (which featured as the B-side, the only &quot;official&quot; live version of &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot;, until its appearance on Live in Barcelona), but did not succeed, scoring only number 46 on the U.S. pop chart. A music video for the song was released at the time, but confusingly showed a completely unrelated 1986 acoustic performance at a Bridge School Benefit concert.\n\nLive/1975ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“85 is a live album by Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band. It consists of 40 tracks recorded at various concerts between 1975 and 1985. It was released as a box set with either five vinyl records, three cassettes, or three CDs. There was also a record club only release which came on three 8-track cartridges, which is extremely hard to find.\n\nSpringsteen's long-awaited and highly-anticipated live album generated advance orders of more than 1.5 million copies, making it the largest dollar-volume pre-order in the history of the record business at the time. Record stores around the country found fans waiting in line on Monday morning before opening and one New York store reportedly sold the album right off the back of the delivery truck. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard album chart, a rare occurrence that hadn't happened in ten years since Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life in 1976. It also became the first five-record set to reach the top 10 and the first to sell over a million copies.\n\nTwo singles were released from the box set: &quot;War&quot; (a cover of the 1970 Edwin Starr hit), which was a #8 success on the U.S. pop singles chart, and &quot;Fire&quot; (a Springsteen song that was a top 10 hit for The Pointer Sisters in 1979), which only reached #46 on the Billboard charts, breaking Springsteen's string of eight consecutive Top 10 singles. The music video for &quot;War&quot; was taken from the concert where it was recorded, while the video for &quot;Fire&quot; was from a completely unrelated 1986 acoustic performance at a Bridge School Benefit concert. A third video, for &quot;Born to Run&quot;, was also released, which showed a melange of clips from the band's 1984ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“85 Born in the U.S.A. Tour.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab116ac5702b9f998e74ef3eae928ed43d33d71d","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Fire+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab116ac5702b9f998e74ef3eae928ed43d33d71d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,17,106,197,112,43,159,153,142,116,239,62,174,146,142,212,61,51,215,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
