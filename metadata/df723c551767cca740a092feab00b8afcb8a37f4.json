This season HGTV Canada's biggest stars Bryan Baeumler (Leave It To Bryan, House of Bryan), Scott McGillivray (Income Property) and Paul Lafrance (Decked Out, Disater Decks) are on a nationwide search stopping in Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto and Halifax to find Canada's top amateur handyman talent. Along with host Jennifer Robertson, the all-star judging panel will challenge contestants like never before as they whittle down the competition. With bragging rights on the line, the contestant that best handles the pressure and staves off elimination will walk away with the $25,000 prize.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df723c551767cca740a092feab00b8afcb8a37f4","amp;dn":"Canadas.Handyman.Challenge.S03E04.Halifax.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df723c551767cca740a092feab00b8afcb8a37f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,114,60,85,23,103,204,167,64,160,146,254,171,0,184,175,203,138,55,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
