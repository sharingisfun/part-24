Maybe a tad slow, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mess with pitch control with transferring tapes. I try to leave history as exact as it was documented. Bob and the Wailers did a run of shows at the Odeon from June 15th thru the 18th. His mark as the king of reggae was solidified this year with these shows and the ones at the Lyceum show he now had the band in top for and was ready to conquer the world with his messages and positive energy.\n(this text is taken from the Dubwise Garage Collection)\n\nSetlist:\n\nTrenchtown Rock,\nBurninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ And LootinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢,\nThem Belly Full,\nRebel Music,\nCrazy Baldheads,\nI Shot The Sheriff,\nWant More,\nNo More Trouble","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84304ba82f7d665d52132f8888750deb95de7808","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+-+1976-06-16+-+Hammersmith+Odeon%2C+London","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84304ba82f7d665d52132f8888750deb95de7808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,48,75,168,47,125,102,93,82,19,47,136,136,117,13,235,149,222,120,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
