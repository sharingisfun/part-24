As a young publisher, Hugh is sent to interview R., falls in love with Armande on the way, wrests her, after  multiple humiliations, from a grinning Scandinavian and returns to NY with his bride. . . . Eight years later--following a murder, a period of madness and a brief imprisonment--Hugh makes a lone sentimental journey to wheedle out his past. . . . The several strands of dream, memory, and time [are] set off against the literary theorizing of R. and, more centrally, against the world of observable objects.&quot;  --Martin Amis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4b625c8abf6ea8acfb19e4699d4ea02e5f009d6","amp;dn":"TRANSPARENT+THINGS+-+Vladimir+Nabokov+%28Lolita+author%29+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4b625c8abf6ea8acfb19e4699d4ea02e5f009d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,182,37,200,171,246,234,138,207,177,158,70,153,212,234,2,229,240,9,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
