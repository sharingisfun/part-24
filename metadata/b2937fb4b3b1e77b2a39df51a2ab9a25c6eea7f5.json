If you&amp;#039;re already a fan of this music and have cds by many of the artists contained herein, you&amp;#039;ll probably find some songs repeated from your current collection, but you&amp;#039;ll also find a swath of songs by more obscure artists than those mentioned here... \nI certainly hadn&amp;#039;t heard of Keith Loyd, Bill Strength or Andy Schroder. \nThe mastering/recording quality is generally pretty good.\nThanks go to this German record label for offering up this great old \nAmerican music so affordably.\n\n\nDisk: 8  \n1.
