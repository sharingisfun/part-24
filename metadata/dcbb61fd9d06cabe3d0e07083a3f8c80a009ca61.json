It was released on Warner Bros.\n Records on 28 February 1970\n\nThe yang to Astral Weeks' yin, the brilliant Moondance is every bit as much a classic as its predecessor;\n Van Morrison's first commercially successful solo effort, it retains the previous album's deeply spiritual thrust \nbut transcends its bleak, cathartic intensity to instead explore themes of renewal and redemption. Light, soulful, \nand jazzy, Moondance opens with the sweetly nostalgic &quot;And It Stoned Me,&quot; the song's pastoral imagery establishing\n the dominant lyrical motif recurring throughout the album -- virtually every track exults in natural wonder,\n whether it's the nocturnal magic celebrated by the title cut or the unlimited promise offered in &quot;Brand New Day.&quot; \nAt the heart of the record is &quot;Caravan,&quot; an incantatory ode to the power of radio; equally stirring is the majestic\n&quot;Into the Mystic,&quot; a song of such elemental beauty and grace as to stand as arguably the quintessential Morrison moment.\n\n==================================\n\nTracklist\n\nA1 \t\tStoned Me \t4:30 \t\nA2 \t\tMoondance \t4:35 \t\nA3 \t\tCrazy Love      2:34 \t\nA4 \t\tCaravan \t4:57 \t\nA5 \t\tInto The Mystic \t3:25 \t\nB1 \t\tCome Running \t2:30 \t\nB2 \t\tThese Dreams Of You \t3:50 \t\nB3 \t\tBrand New Day       5:09 \t\nB4 \t\tEveryone \t3:31 \t\nB5 \t\tGlad Tidings      3:13\n\n=========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 776 MB\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 712 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Moondance\nTrack name/Total                         : 10\nPerformer                                : Van Morrison\nGenre                                    : Rock\nRecorded date                            : 1970\nComment                                  : WB/Rhino 180g Re-Issue; Mastered by Kevin Gray@AcousTech\n\n===========================================\n\nAudio\n\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 712 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits\nWriting library                          : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcbb61fd9d06cabe3d0e07083a3f8c80a009ca61","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Moondance+%281970%29+Flac%5B24Bit+96KHz+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcbb61fd9d06cabe3d0e07083a3f8c80a009ca61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,187,97,253,157,6,202,190,61,14,7,8,58,63,140,128,160,9,202,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
