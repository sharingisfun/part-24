As some of you may know I am Andy Mahoney, I run Home Brew Power and up until no it has been a hobby.\nYou may be asking yourself why I have decided to take the plunge and create a magazine? The truth is that every moment of my life my head is spinning with all the issues of sustainable living, new projects, concepts, what others are doing out there to make a difference to our planets wellbeing.\n\nSo it hit me that my heart is not in my 9 to 5 job as a\nn electrician. I feel that my heart lies in getting all the exciting content in my head across to other like minded indi-viduals. It is what I want to do, it is what I have always wanted to do.\n\n\nThe dream is alive!\n\nAndy M - Creator Of The HomeBrewPower Magazine &amp; Website\n\nVisit www homebrewpower co uk - Insert Dots ;-)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:650497f3bb57a4b5951165a13c8d2c67702fd664","amp;dn":"HBP+-+Volume+1+-+Issue+01.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"650497f3bb57a4b5951165a13c8d2c67702fd664","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,4,151,243,187,87,164,181,149,17,101,161,60,141,44,103,112,47,214,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
