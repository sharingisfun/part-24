Here's some propaganda to disseminate. Jim Marrs debunked this on the Alex Jones show already.\n\n\nProgram Info:\nOn Sunday, Nov. 16, 2008, at 9 PM (ET/PT), The Discovery Channel presents JFK: Inside the Target Car, the closest look yet at the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nFor the show, The Discovery Channel has assembled a team of experts to set up an array of ballistic tests and trajectory analysis, as well as the latest in forensic artificial body creation.\n\nWith methodical cutting-edge forensics and Zapruder film archives, the experts painstakingly show that the fatal bullet was fired from the Texas School Book Depository, not the grassy knoll.\n\nThe Discovery Channel worked with Adelaide T&amp;E Systems, an engineering company that specializes in creating exact human specimens utilized in military weaponry development.\n\nUsing KennedyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hat size, the experts created a replica of a human head, with the size and density. A special effects team also completely recreated the Presidential limousine passenger area.\n\nJFK: Inside the Target Car &quot;is the latest example of using breakthrough technology to authenticate scientific theories,&quot; said John Ford, president and general manager, Discovery Channel.  &quot;This special encompasses an intensive forensic investigation that proves the origin of the fatal bullet. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s momentous for the network to help support the science behind this definitive evidence.&quot;\n\nThe investigation team:\n\n- Gary Mack, Curator of The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, and a 25-year veteran of Kennedy investigations\n- Michael Yardley, world renowned sharpshooter\n- Wesley Fisk, Chief Operating Officer of Adelaide T&amp;E Systems\n- Tom Bevel and Steve Schlieble, veteran crime scene and forensic examiners\n\nInterviews with key players from that November day helped assemble the pieces of the puzzle. Jack McNairy and H.B. McLain are two eyewitnesses who saw the blood-splattered limo before the Secret Service ordered it cleaned and sent back to Washington, D.C. Bobby Hargis, a Dallas police officer who rode directly behind the limo, provided crucial information about the effects of gunfire.\n\nAnd finally, the late Nellie Connally, in one of her last recorded interviews, talked about being in the car with her husband, Texas Governor John Connally, President and Mrs. Kennedy.\n\nIn the show, Yardley looked through the scope of a high-powered rifle from four different possible angles focused on a duplicate Presidential limousine. The limo was in the exact spot where Kennedy was fired on and filled with actors the same size as the passengers that day.\n\nFrom vantage points at the south end of the overpass, the north end of the overpass and on the grassy knoll, Yardley determined whether a shot could have come from a second gunman at any of these spots.\n\nAfter careful analysis of possible shot locations, the forensics team structured on a California firing range the exact distances, angles, and even wind speed in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. High-speed cameras rolled as Yardley took his best shot at the head replicas, using a Mannlicher Carcano rifle - the same type supposedly used by Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nThe results of these precision ballistics tests provide some clear answers to the events in Dealey Plaza. Comparing the splatter patterns from these test angles, with the historical evidence gleaned from eyewitness testimony and Secret Service reports, as well as an exact digitized overlay of the Zapruder film, the forensic team draws the definitive conclusion that the fatal shot could have only come from the sixth floor window of the Book Depository and not anywhere else, just as the Warren Commission determined in 1964.\n\n\nVideo Info:\nDisc.Ch.JFK.Inside.The.Target.Car.2008.640x480.xvid.mp3-snach.avi\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 750 MiB\nDuration                         : 42mn 53s\nOveral bit rate                  : 2443 Kbps\nWriting application              : MediaCoder 0.6\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warpoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 42mn 53s\nBit rate                         : 2318 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.654\nFrame rate                       : 30.000 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.251\nStream size                      : 711 MiB\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 42mn 53s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 112 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 34.4 MiB\n\nSorry that I couldn't get it under 700mb, video encoder was actin up.
