SeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live performance came to a premature conclusion in the late winter of 2008, but in the 15 years that preceded that, friends, family and fellow musicians were treated to an astonishing artistic development.\n\nHis early years (from about 11-14 yrs old) were spent in the shed, playing along to traditional blues and jazz albums and sitting in with local blues players. He exploded onto the national scene in 1995 winning the international blues competition for solo acoustic act Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a victory that garnered him his first record deal producing CALL THE COPS, a Memphis-based management deal and tour dates from the Mississippi Delta through the Florida panhandle. Sean expanded his horizons teaming up with New-Englander Susan Tedeschi at the Springing the Blues Fest in Jacksonville, FL. The dates became more plentiful, the rooms larger and cities further apart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de73ae528413f3237204fdf3182aaac3bf09585d","amp;dn":"Sean+Costello+-+Call+The+Cops+%5B1998%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de73ae528413f3237204fdf3182aaac3bf09585d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,115,174,82,132,19,243,35,114,4,253,243,24,42,170,195,191,9,88,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
