(possibly Kazumi Totaka)\nRipped by: Drakken\nRecorded with: Audacity 1.2.4\nEncoder: Lame 3.96.1\nVBR: 192\n# of tracks: 15\nLength: 0:35:33\nSize: 51.42 MB\n\n~Comments~\n\nThe Wii is unique in that each of its &quot;channels&quot; features original music. There are some main channel themes like the Mii and Shop channels&amp;#039; tunes, but then it goes deeper in the Weather and Photo channels, with the latter having 9 songs. 6 of these are tunes that you can choose to have played while a slideshow of your photos is shown, and I have to say they&amp;#039;re pretty cool. They&amp;#039;re actually full songs, not just short looping melodies.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s amazing to me that Nintendo has tunes for all these menus. This is one of the things I love about them. The fact that someone took the time to compose songs for all these screens is just fantastic, as it&amp;#039;s certainly not something you&amp;#039;d expect in most consoles. Of course, the Wii&amp;#039;s channel setup isn&amp;#039;t exactly ordinary, but still, you get my point.\n\nHere&amp;#039;s a breakdown of the tracks: \n\n1 - Mii Channel (1:53) - What you hear when you&amp;#039;re watching your Miis walk around. \n2 - Shop Channel Title (0:35) - The short ditty that plays before you actually enter the Shop Channel. It lets you know, &quot;Aw yeah, THAT song is coming up.&quot; \n3 - Shop Channel (1:58) - THAT song. It makes spending money enjoyable. \n4 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Calm) (2:44) - A nice piano song. It&amp;#039;s the only one (iirc) that doesn&amp;#039;t loop. \n5 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Fun) (3:09) - As the title suggests, it&amp;#039;s a fun, bouncy ditty. \n6 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Bright) (3:06) - A very up-tempo track. Parts of it remind me of Super Monkey Ball music. \n7 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Nostalgic) (2:31) - I guess it&amp;#039;s nostalgic? Piano &amp; strings. \n8 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Beautiful) (3:18) - This one&amp;#039;s a misnomer; it&amp;#039;s actually an up-tempo jazzy song. Although, I guess you could consider that beautiful. One of my favorites. \n9 - Photo Channel - Slideshow (Scenic) (5:44) - Ambient music. The longest by far, since it takes awhile to develop. \n10 - Photo Channel - Fun (Doodle) (2:10) - A slow, jazzy vibes thing. \n11 - Photo Channel - Fun (Puzzle) (0:44) - More mallets! This time, it&amp;#039;s a cute little xylophone melody. \n12. Photo Channel - Message Board (1:14) - Happy, I guess? Not a whole lot to this one. \n13. Weather Channel (2:07) - This one&amp;#039;s nice. It&amp;#039;s a cheerful tune featuring pizzicato strings, a flute, and yet more mallets. \n14. Weather Channel - Globe (2:45) - Ideal globe-viewing music. \n15. Weather Channel - Globe (Location) (2:44) - A more low-key version of the above song. It doesn&amp;#039;t have the deep strings.\n\nI hope everyone enjoys and appreciates this music.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:507c7e953fd86adbf188453de4eead4983cc5703","amp;dn":"Wii+Menu+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"507c7e953fd86adbf188453de4eead4983cc5703","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,124,126,149,63,216,106,219,241,136,69,61,228,238,173,73,131,204,87,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
