The 90-minute documentary will showcase never-before-seen footage and untold stories of how the most dominant team ever assembled returned USA Basketball to glory, while turning basketball into a global phenomenon. The world had rarely seen a frenzy as the one the Dream Team created when it arrived in Barcelona, Spain, in July 1992. The Dream Team featured 11 future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame players and three future Hall of Famers on the coaching staff, including head coach Chuck Daly. NBA TV's &quot;The Dream Team&quot; presented by Right GuardÃ‚Â® will take viewers on a behind-the-scenes journey into the selection of the team, the dynamic personalities, the legendary team-building experiences in training camp and exhibitions, and ultimately its rock-star-type unveiling in Barcelona.\n\n\nVideo format: mp4 720p 60fps\n\nCredit: Kenshiro","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37462c7de5e789b8104a01d092520a434fb4827b","amp;dn":"NBATv.The.Dream.Team.%2813+june+2012%29.720p.HDTV.60fps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37462c7de5e789b8104a01d092520a434fb4827b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,70,44,125,229,231,137,184,16,74,1,208,146,82,10,67,79,180,130,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
