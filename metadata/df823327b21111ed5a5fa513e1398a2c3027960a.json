Search is hard, though! That's why search engines such as Elasticsearch and Apache Solr are so popular.\r\n\r\nIn this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor JosÃ© Mota will show you how to incorporate search into your web application. You'll create an application for searching a database of Envato Tuts+ courses with features such as date range filtering, full-text search, and search result pagination. Follow along and you'll see how to implement these features with Elasticsearch or with Sunspot (a Ruby interface to Apache Solr)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df823327b21111ed5a5fa513e1398a2c3027960a","amp;dn":"Tutsplus+-+Compare+Ruby+Search+Engines_SL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df823327b21111ed5a5fa513e1398a2c3027960a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,130,51,39,178,17,17,237,90,95,165,19,225,57,138,44,48,39,150,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
