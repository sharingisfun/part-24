An album of\nextreme musical strength, atomizing everything in its way in the\nquest for the ultimate light, for that burning unreachable point\nat the end of the infinite horizon. Thirteen powerful new\ntracks, each standing alone by itself and bringing its very own\ncontribution to the album's sound depth and concept theme.\n\nRevolting metal guitar riffs, raging industrial beats, fast\ncatchy synth sequences and Bonnie's provocative juvenile\nfiltered female vocals (both in English and in French) backed by\nSeven's harsher voice make the eclectic universe of KRYSTAL\nSYSTEM who here deliver one of the best albums ever released by\nBelgium's prestigious Alfa Matrix label. &quot;Nuclear&quot; is an album\nfull to the brim with dynamics, grooves, anger and melodies\nwhich breathes and transpires a forceful creativity and an\nastounding song-writing maturity the whole collection of songs\nbenefits from top-notch production work from the prestigious\nParisian &quot;Studios d'Or&quot; and is crowned by the sharp mastering\nwork of Swift in London.\n\nFresh, brilliant, dark, upbeat and heavy, &quot;Nuclear&quot; is a\nsplendid album performed with no compromise but in all\nsimplicity at the crossroads of industrial metal and electro\nrock.\n\nThe limited box edition of the album comes with poster and a\nthirteen-track bonus CD featuring several exclusive remixes and\nunreleased tracks, plus collaborations with artists such as\nAMGOD, IMPLANT, PUNISH YOURSELF, TREPONEM PAL and the famous\nJapanese DJ TAIKI, DJ ETHAN FAWKES and DJs DRILL/EDRIVE69.\n\nGROUPNOTES\n\nFWYH : FUCK WHAT YOU HEARD, We're all about Family\nDedication, Quality, Respect &amp; LOVE for the music\nAs the years pass, all our motives and objectives\nremain,we want to give the best of dark electronic\ngenres,with the quality deserved for the only true\nunderground scene, the Future is these genres\n\nTo all the artists that we release, some newcomers\n&amp; other established acts: We are sorry if you dont\nunderstand the promotion we do, of your own work,\nbut if you make quality music, we are pretty sure\nthat a lot of people will spend their own money on\nyour art.
