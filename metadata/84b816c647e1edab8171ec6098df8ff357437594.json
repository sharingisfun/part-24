These symphonies were the first to be written for Prince Esterhazy. They retain features of the old concerto grosso style, so the winds, horns, and strings get many chances at solo passages.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b816c647e1edab8171ec6098df8ff357437594","amp;dn":"Haydn+-+Symphonies+Nos.+6%2C+7%2C+8+-+Hogwood%2C+AAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b816c647e1edab8171ec6098df8ff357437594","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,184,22,198,71,225,237,171,129,113,236,96,152,223,143,243,87,67,117,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
