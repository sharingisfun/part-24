In GUILTY, Coulter explodes this myth to reveal that when it comes to bullying, no one outdoes the Left. GUILTY is a mordantly witty and shockingly specific catalog of offenses which Coulter presents from A to Z. And as with each of her past books, all of which were NYT bestsellers, Coulter is fearless in her penchant for saying what needs saying about politics and culture today.\n\nAbout the Author\nANN COULTER is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of If Democrats Had Any Brains, TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d Be Republicans; Godless; How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must); Treason; Slander; and High Crimes and Misdemeanors.
