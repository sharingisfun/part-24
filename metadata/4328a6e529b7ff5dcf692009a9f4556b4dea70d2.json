Takemitsu was able to work in a wide variety of styles -- pop arrangements, electronic music, modern choral melodies, his own unique avant-garde and poetic orchestral writing -- and always produced notable and well-crafted composition; possibly the fact that he was largely self-taught enabled him to bypass many of the inhibitions of composers who are members of &quot;schools.&quot; This collection of film scores demonstrates almost all of these styles: music from director Hiroshi Teshigahara's &quot;Rikyu&quot; (including traditional songs, European Baroque era music, massive and dramatic sustained sounds), a suite for strings of music for three films -- Teshigahara's &quot;JosÃƒÂ© Torres&quot; (with jazz underscoring shots of boxing rings and gyms in New York City), Teshigahara's &quot;The Face of Another&quot; (with isolated soundforms and Kurt Weill-like tunes), and Shohei Imamura's &quot;Black Rain&quot; (elegiac funeral music underscoring images of the Hiroshima bombing), music from &quot;Harakiri&quot; for biwa, music from Masahiro Shinoda's &quot;Banished Orin,&quot; &quot;Kaseki (The Fossil),&quot; Nagisa Oshima's remarkable &quot;Empire of Passion,&quot; music from &quot;Dodes'kaden, and the astonishing and highly emotional score for Teshigahara's &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; in which Takemitsu electronically processed instrumental sounds to create wholly new timbres.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4328a6e529b7ff5dcf692009a9f4556b4dea70d2","amp;dn":"Film+Music+by+Toru+Takemitsu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4328a6e529b7ff5dcf692009a9f4556b4dea70d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,40,166,229,41,183,255,93,207,105,32,9,169,244,85,107,77,234,112,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
