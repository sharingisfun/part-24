Forty per cent of the world's seaborne oil passes\nthrough the narrow strait between Iran and the Musandam peninsular, a rugged\nregion of Oman. In this remote and other worldly region of vast cliffs and deep\ninlets Simon witnesses a thriving smuggling trade between Oman and Iran and\nvisits the isolated village of Kumzar which boasts its own unique language and\na lifestyle that has changed little in centuries. For centuries Omani traders\nsailed the monsoon winds across the Indian Ocean and Simon's next port of call\nis one of their traditional destinations and one of the biggest cities on\nearth. The packed mega-city of Mumbai is never more chaotic than during the\nannual festival of Ganesh, and Simon joins the celebration as thousands of\nstatues are paraded to the Indian Ocean. During his visit Simon investigates\nthe impact of IndiaÃƒâ€ s booming population on the ocean and meets fishermen\nreporting an alarming drop in fish stocks. But nowhere are the threats to the\nocean more apparent than in the Maldives archipelago. Simon is overwhelmed by\nthe beauty of the Maldives, one of the most beautiful locations he has ever\nvisited, but discovers that the breathtaking coral atolls face a series of\nalarming threats. As well as snorkelling and free-diving with dozens of manta\nrays, Simon witnesses the disturbing phenomenon of coral bleaching, which is\nleading to a frightening decline in the world's coral reefs. Simon realises\neven the paradise Maldives are not immune from the challenges facing the rest\nof the planet, but nothing prepares him for an astonishing trip to the Maldives\nrubbish island, a stinking toxic landfill dump for the island's waste.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f59ec4a7c51444ab63e9bfaedb63997f4df9f1a","amp;dn":"Indian+Ocean+++%28BBC+2012+-+Part+4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f59ec4a7c51444ab63e9bfaedb63997f4df9f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,89,236,74,124,81,68,74,182,62,155,250,237,182,57,151,244,223,159,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
