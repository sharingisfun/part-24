Completely decentralized and anonymous trading client.\n\n This is not the first application what claims to be a decentralized marketplace. But all other known development is based on servers, and should still need admin. If admin and 1 of 2 sides it is one person they can steal your money.\nIn other &quot;decentralized&quot; platforms  admin or moderator can always remove your goods or service. Besides, if he loses access or die you will lose money and platform can`t work.\n Why is my trading platform is fully decentralized and anonymous?\n Base is the bitmessage network .\n All transactions are in the form of escrow with multisig 2-2. For each transaction creates 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹multisig address. One for the primary and two for the payment of insurance.\n No servers, only peer to peer.\n When a customer starts a transaction, he first puts 5% of the amount to one of the addresses. After the seller saw that the money transferred to multisig address, he also takes 5% of the amount in the second of three addresses. Only after that the buyer transfers 100% of the third multisig address. Each side has only one key from each address, but you need two to translate from it.\nThis means that if the deal is not completed, the seller will lose his own money and money for goods. But the buyer is not able to get back  the money.\nIf the buyer is satisfied with the deal, and want to get their 5% back he should sign the deal. 5% insurance payment  just returned to buyer and seller if the transaction is completed successfully. Insurance payment from merchant need to avoid cases of extortion. This makes it just not profitable. At the same time, the buyer insurance payment stimulates him to sign a deal if he is satisfied with the product or service.\nSince this is the first version and I just finished it. It may be a problem with security. By this, I cut all trade functions except the escrow deal.\n What makes this version:\n Creating an escrow deal, signing a deal or cancel. Anonymous communication and few wallet functions.\nYou can test the security. Client works through bitcoin-qt, it is currently configured to use testnet. If anyone needed testnet btc, leave here address I'll send few to you.\n After deal sometime you dont see that money in your wallet.\n Sometimes, after the deal is completed you will not see that money in your wallet. To see them you need to do -rescan. To do this, run the bitcoin-qt from &quot;btc&quot; folder with parameters -rescan and -datadir =%folder_where_you_copy_BitXbay.exe%/btc\n This is because the rescan process is too long. I'm afraid to load them. In the next version probably will do a separate button for this. If I do not come up with something better.\n The blockchain in the folder btc  block. Btc folder should be there where you unpack BitXBay.\n Please post here security bugs.\n In the next version I'll post all the hotfixes and trading platform. Theoretically, BitXBay resisted to spam, flooding, unscrupulous sellers, government bans and the main developer elimination.\n All in open source and you can modify BitXBay how you want.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acdae315e1c5cbfdcf31a601102749575c49e154","amp;dn":"BitXBay+v.1.4.4b+vmware+image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acdae315e1c5cbfdcf31a601102749575c49e154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,218,227,21,225,197,203,253,207,49,166,1,16,39,73,87,92,73,225,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
