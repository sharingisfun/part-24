With a booming economy and massive social changes, there is a swagger to this once-sleeping giant, but what do we know of it apart from football and carnival? Michael Palin has travelled across most of the globe over the years, but never to Brazil. In this four-part series he crosses the country as big as a continent to find out what makes it tick.\n\n\n\n\n2)  Into Amazonia \nThe Python star continues his first visit to Brazil by travelling by river from the northern border with Venezuela to the capital of Brasilia. Along the way he visits indigenous tribe the Yanomami, learning about the threat to their hunter-gatherer way of life, before watching a rehearsal by the Amazon Philharmonic Orchestra and searching for the remains of Henry Ford's unsuccessful attempt to build a vast rubber plantation in the middle of the rainforest. In Belem, music producer Priscilla explains why Amazonian women are such powerful forces, then he moves southwards, meeting rock star and political activist Dinho Ouro Preto, who believes that despite its social and environmental problems, the country is on the brink of becoming a superpower.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/1855/brazilscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img839.imageshack.us/img839/1855/brazilscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/117/brazilscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/117/brazilscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/8946/brazilscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/8946/brazilscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/8493/brazilscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/8493/brazilscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img87.imageshack.us/img87/3628/brazilscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img87.imageshack.us/img87/3628/brazilscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/6325/brazilscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/6325/brazilscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6537/brazilscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6537/brazilscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/2332/brazilscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/2332/brazilscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/2906/brazilscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/2906/brazilscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1634 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size:746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-10-24/michael-palin-on-brazil-sex-slaves-and-convincing-the-bbc-to-make-his-shows&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-10-24/michael-palin-on-brazil-sex-slaves-and-convincing-the-bbc-to-make-his-shows&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9cab5189b865856563906ceb08566c1bef0f758","amp;dn":"BBC+Brazil+with+Michael+Palin+2of4+Into+Amazonia+PDTV+XviD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9cab5189b865856563906ceb08566c1bef0f758","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,202,181,24,155,134,88,86,86,57,6,206,176,133,102,193,190,240,247,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
