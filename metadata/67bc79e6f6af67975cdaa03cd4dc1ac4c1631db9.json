It became quite successful in those days, and if you look at it today, you'll find a number of further timeless and still demanded tracks on it: 'Just Listen To My Heart', coupled with 'Pony Express' reached No. 23 on thecharts in 1963. 'Le Dernier Train De LÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢espace' became a huge success in Japan around 1965 (and was covered by the American guitar-band 'Ventures' in 1979). 'Happy Guitar' went successful in France and 'Last Date' is another highlight which is featured in the band's concerts since its release. This CD also includes several interesting additional tracks such as the old English traditional 'My Bonnie' (also used for their appearance in the English movie 'Just for Fun'), the classic 'Johnny Guitar', still alive and unforgettable, and 'Old Clock At Home', an old Swedish traditional. These bonus tracks were mostly recorded at Bo Winberg's home, by using his own self-built equipment. This music don't have the over-perfection of today's productions - but it features what we call handmade, clear and powerful, nostalgic,\nbut surely not old-fashionedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nKarl-Heinz Villis (1989)\n(CD liner notes)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spotnicks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spotnicks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.spotnicks.net/uk/index_uk.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.spotnicks.net/uk/index_uk.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Spotnicks In Paris - The Spotnicks\noriginal album 1963\nThis CD 1989\n\n01  The Spotnicks In Paris - Just Listen To My Heart\n02  The Spotnicks In Paris - JoeyÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s Song\n03  The Spotnicks In Paris - Old Faithful\n04  The Spotnicks In Paris - Say Mama\n05  The Spotnicks In Paris - Last Date\n06  The Spotnicks In Paris - Le Dernier Train De L'espace\n07  The Spotnicks In Paris - Hot Toddy\n08  The Spotnicks In Paris - Pony Express\n09  The Spotnicks In Paris - Western Guitar\n10  The Spotnicks In Paris - Skintops Blues\n11  The Spotnicks In Paris - Blue Blue Day\n12  The Spotnicks In Paris - Happy Guitar\n13  The Spotnicks In Paris - Comme Ci Comme CA\n14  The Spotnicks In Paris - Trambone\n15  The Spotnicks In Paris - My Bonnie\n16  The Spotnicks In Paris - Johnny Guitar\n17  The Spotnicks In Paris - Old Clock At Home\n18  The Spotnicks In Paris - Endless Walk\n19  The Spotnicks In Paris - What Did I Say\n20  The Spotnicks In Paris - Galloping Guitars\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67bc79e6f6af67975cdaa03cd4dc1ac4c1631db9","amp;dn":"Spotnicks+-+The+Spotnicks+in+Paris+%281989%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67bc79e6f6af67975cdaa03cd4dc1ac4c1631db9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,188,121,230,246,175,103,151,92,218,160,60,212,220,26,196,193,99,29,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
