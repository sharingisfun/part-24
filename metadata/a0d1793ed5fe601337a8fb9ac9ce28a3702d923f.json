As with other books in this series, and with all Time-Life Books, the present volume is impressively illustrated with color photographs, maps, drawings, and charts. Readers will be especially interested in the well-known terra cotta army of Qin Shihuangdi, China's first emperor, and the lesser-known tomb of Lady Xin of the Han Dynasty, remarkably well preserved more than two millenniums after her death. The text is informative, presenting much detail in a manner accessible to general readers (though the use of pinyin romanization should have been accompanied by the more traditional and, for many people, more recognizable, Wade-Giles system). Recommended for general collections serving young adult as well as older readers.\n\n- Kenneth W. Berger, Duke Univ.
