Many areas of significant progress include dynamics of musculoskeletal systems, mechanics of hard and soft tissues, mechanics of bone remodeling, mechanics of blood and air flow, flow-prosthesis interfaces, mechanics of impact, dynamics of man-machine interaction, and more. Thus, the great breadth and significance of the field in the international scene require a well integrated set of volumes to provide a complete coverage of the exciting subject of biomechanical systems technology. World-renowned contributors tackle the latest technologies in an in-depth and readable manner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e31763055bf45bc4a11744962967db93999875e","amp;dn":"Biomechanical+Systems+Technology%3A+General+Anatomy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e31763055bf45bc4a11744962967db93999875e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,49,118,48,85,191,69,188,74,17,116,73,98,150,125,185,57,153,135,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
