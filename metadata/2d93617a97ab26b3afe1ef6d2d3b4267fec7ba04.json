In less than two years, \r\nhe has released nearly a dozen mixes and branded himself as a trap mastermind whose \r\nheart beats drum and bass. His career erupted in 2013 with the success of \r\nâ€œShakedown,â€ a heavy beat-dropping original track with crunchy snares and 808s. Almost instantly, the record got picked up by LOUDPVCK, whose up-tempo remix hyped its way to being featured in Under the Electric Sky. Today the song has now reached over a million plays on Soundcloud.\r\n\r\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d93617a97ab26b3afe1ef6d2d3b4267fec7ba04","amp;dn":"Jackal+Electronic+Trap+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d93617a97ab26b3afe1ef6d2d3b4267fec7ba04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,147,97,122,151,171,38,179,175,225,239,109,45,59,66,103,254,199,186,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
