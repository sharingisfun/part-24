The Tu-16 is no longer in service, except chinese-made copycats still used by the RPC's PLA and possibly the DPRK. The Tu-22 has long been retired, replaced by the more modern TU-26 (also known as the Tu-22M).\nThe disclosure of this document shall not have a significant effect on global balance of armed forces, as the radar it describes has long been ineffective against modern fighter interceptors sporting low radar signature and onboard jamming equipment. In fact the tail gunner layout lost most of its effectiveness after AIM-9 Sidewinder and other air combat guided missiles were introduced to fighter jet service from 1958 on.\n\nNote\nNote: English-language version of technical manual, as it is an exported copy. The Soviet Union exported most flight-related documents to foreign buyers in English.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a21e539f1ba6a02c008ed0858553f9bf757b411","amp;dn":"Soviet+radar+technical+manual+1950%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a21e539f1ba6a02c008ed0858553f9bf757b411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,33,229,57,241,186,106,2,192,8,237,8,88,85,63,155,247,87,180,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
