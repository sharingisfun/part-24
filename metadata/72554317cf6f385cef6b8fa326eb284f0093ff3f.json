Rarely matched in the genre, her music is more than just intelligent, its remarkably listenable. His song fills my Sunday afternoons with soft, jazzy reveries and I'll be crying for you is almost pop. Songs like Alan Bean have developed a cult-like following and have made this album a must-have.\nIt's been said numerous times that Stina's music isn't for everyone. It's not. Only those with working ears can appreciate this Scandinavian treasure. (review on amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nStina Nordenstam - Memories of a color 1991\n(Stockholm Telegram/Caprice)\n\n1.
