But often, as he grows up, the boy who needs her simultaneously pushes her away. Calling upon thirty years of experience as a pediatrician, Meg Meeker, M.D., a highly sought after national speaker, assistant professor of clinical medicine, and mother of four, shares the secrets that every mother needs to know in order to strengthenâ€”or rebuildâ€”her relationship with her son.\r\n\r\nBoys today face unique challenges and pressures, and the burden on mothers to guide their boys through them can feel overwhelming. This empowering book offers a road map to help mothers find the strength and confidence to raise extraordinary sons by providing encouragement, education, and practical advice about\r\n\r\nâ€¢ the need for mothers to exercise courage and be bolder and more confident about advising and directing their boys\r\n\r\nâ€¢ the crucial role mothers play in expressing love to sons in healthy ways so they learn to respect and appreciate women as they grow up\r\n\r\nâ€¢ the importance of teaching sons about the values of hard work, community service, and a well-developed inner life\r\n\r\nâ€¢ the natural traps mothers of boys often fall intoâ€”and how to avoid them\r\n\r\nâ€¢ the need for a mother to heal her own wounds with the men in her life so she can raise her son without baggage and limitations\r\n\r\nâ€¢ the best ways to survive the moments when the going gets tough and a momâ€™s natural ways of communicatingâ€”talking, analyzing, exploringâ€”only fuel the fire\r\n\r\nWhen a mother holds her baby boy for the first time, she also instinctively knows something else: If she does her job right and raises her son with self-esteem, support, and wisdom, he will become the man she knows he was meant to be","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe619c9188dabe2384f9da791cda3fae7e6e94d6","amp;dn":"Strong+Mothers%2C+Strong+Sons+-+Meg+Meeker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe619c9188dabe2384f9da791cda3fae7e6e94d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,97,156,145,136,218,190,35,132,249,218,121,28,218,63,174,126,110,148,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
