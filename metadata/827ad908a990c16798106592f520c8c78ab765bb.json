Lately there has been a lot of stir about internet rights and copyright infringement. If those laws went through, my art would be highly illegal.\n\nI'm not a rich, big shot producer.. i'm a dirt poor college kid who happens to make electronic music.\n\nSo fuck them. information doesn't have the same social dynamic as a tangible object. Information wants to be free and spread based on the quality of the content. With that in mind, download this album. If you like what you hear, seed it and show it to your friends.\n\nI hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I did making it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:827ad908a990c16798106592f520c8c78ab765bb","amp;dn":"Opus+Anomaly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"827ad908a990c16798106592f520c8c78ab765bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,122,217,8,169,144,193,103,152,16,101,146,245,32,200,199,138,183,101,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
