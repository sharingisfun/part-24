The soundtrack features only some of the songs included in the film, but what a collection of cuts it is. \nBunny Wailer's anthemic title track, Inner Circle's infectious &quot;We a Rockers,&quot; Jacob Miller's masterpiece &quot;Tenement Yard,&quot; Peter Tosh's threatening &quot;Stepping Razor,&quot; Junior Byles' equally forceful &quot;Fade Away&quot; -- classic songs one and all. \nGorgeous harmonies are delivered up by the Maytones, Justin Hines &amp; the Dominoes, and the Heptones on some of their greatest songs. Jamaica's smoothest singer, Gregory Isaacs, performs a sublime &quot;Slavemaster,&quot; Junior Murvin's sweet tones simmer across &quot;Police and Thieves,&quot; and Kiddus I delivers up an extraordinary cultural toast. \nOne of the most arresting scenes in the film belonged to Burning Spear's Winston Rodney, performing a powerful a cappella &quot;Jah No Dead.&quot; It is just as potent on record, and segues exquisitely into Third World's loving cover of &quot;Satta Amasagana.&quot; \nFrom rockers to grounations, Rockers had it all, and the soundtrack remains one of the most diverse yet coherent albums of the roots age.
