Grand Funk Railroad toured constantly to packed arenas worldwide. A popular take on the band during its heyday was that, although the critics hated them, audiences loved them. The band's name is a play on words of the Grand Trunk Railroad, a railroad line that ran through the band's home town of Flint, Michigan.\n\n.: Grand Funk Railroad Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img48.imageshack.us/img48/6269/1219264ayp0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img48.imageshack.us/img48/6269/1219264ayp0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nOn time (1969)\nGrand Funk Railroad (1970)\nCloser to home (1970)\nLive album (1970)\nSurvival (1971)\nE pluribus Funk (1971)\nMark, Don &amp; Mel (1972)\nPhoenix (1972)\nWe're an american band (1973)\nShinin' on (1974)\nAll the girls in world beware!!!
