Throughout her journey she must traverse dangerous worlds and fight countless hellspawn in order to discover where Jehâ€™Oul lurks and save the world from his demonic clutch.\r\n\r\nThe game takes inspiration from &quot;Megaman&quot;, &quot;Cave Story&quot;, and &quot;Castlevania&quot;, along with a host of masochistic retro platformers, while cutting out the arbitrary difficulty of hidden traps and pixel-perfect jumps in favor of skill based gameplay. The game aims to capture the attention of the same core group of players as its spiritual precursor, &quot;I Wanna be the Boshy&quot;, including the hardcore-platformer lovers and the speedrunning community, all while appealing to a broader audience through a variety of difficulty levels and modifiers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e67e58bc569d34caedbfc1fdd72e72da069b082","amp;dn":"Wings+of+Vi+v1.12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e67e58bc569d34caedbfc1fdd72e72da069b082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,103,229,139,197,105,211,76,174,219,252,31,221,114,231,45,160,105,176,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
