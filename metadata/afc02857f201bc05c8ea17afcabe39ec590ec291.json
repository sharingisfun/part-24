With over 24 hours of teaching, this verse-by-verse study of the book of Genesis has been one of our most sought-after and best-selling series in the history of Koinonia House.\n\nChuck Missler  --  Genesis  --  Was the Universe created in 16 billion years or in 6 days?\n\nThe answer will amaze both Creationist and the Evolutionist. Did we evolve from rocks to single cells, to lizards, snakes, fish, bugs, monkeys and other creatures? Do we die and we are then worth nothing more than dirt? Is that all there is? Or do I live on forever in a timeless eternity in multiple(11)dimensions. Do I want to live in a multi dimensional, timeless Universe? YES YES YES !!\n\nTo calculate time you need to know the Speed of Light. Einsteins famous theory E=MC2 figures times accurately using the speed of light as a constant factor. But what if the Speed light is slowing DOwn? 10,000 years ago light was a million faster than today. What does that do to time? It makes the 16 billion years old the Evolutionist say the Universe was created in, guess what.................. ....................equals 6 days, he saw it was good and he rested. Google: Barry Setterfield and speed of light.\n\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!! The First down loaders of my torrents get the Main Hookups on my SERVER.
