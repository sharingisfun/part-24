The drummer acts like an octopus, but he does not play like Aldridge or R. Castillo, or even the FNM guy... He is more image than sound ! The bass player is so ... normal. The Guitar player is OK !\nA great number of  songs was shot by clawbrz and mgfri(thanks a lot for the great work, the credits are included at the dvd menu this time).\n For a sample, check their videos at youtube and watch it at a resolution of 720 or 1080) and give them a very nice rating !!\n\n\n\n\nif you want the volume one of the new CiceroÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s HD series: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6335434/Iron_Maiden_-_Rio_de_Janeiro_2011_2dvd_HD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6335434/Iron_Maiden_-_Rio_de_Janeiro_2011_2dvd_HD&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nBark at the Moon\nLet Me Hear You Scream\nMr. Crowley\nI Don't Know\nFairies Wear Boots\n(Black Sabbath cover)\nSuicide Solution\nRoad to Nowhere\nWar Pigs\n(Black Sabbath cover)\nShot in the Dark\nRat Salad\n(Black Sabbath cover) (Drums &amp; Guitar Solo)\nIron Man\n(Black Sabbath cover)\nI Don't Want to Change the World\nCrazy Train\nEncore:\nMama, I'm Coming Home\nParanoid \n\nNote: During the guitar solo in the song Rat Salad, Gus G played a small part of the Brazilian song &quot;Brasileirinho&quot; \n\nDVD\n\nFeel free to make a cover, please include in it the Cicero Productions logo, that is included in the torrent and credits to the filmers  !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b05af7377c99185ac8e99762f89c1043ff6364","amp;dn":"Ozzy+Osbourne++Rio+de+Janeiro+2011+HD+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b05af7377c99185ac8e99762f89c1043ff6364","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,176,90,247,55,124,153,24,90,200,233,151,98,248,156,16,67,255,99,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
