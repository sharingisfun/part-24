It seems all the women had one thing in common; they were members of the Crescent Moon Dating Agency. \n\nWhen Alex registers with the agency and gets nowhere she decides to take matters into her own hands and invents Speed Dating, much to the distaste of the agencies owner, Elaine Downing. \n\nAs Luigi's fills up Alex does her best to play the lonely single woman. DI Ray Carling and Chris find themselves an attractive pair of twins to charm, while Gene on the other hand is struggling to attract anyone of the opposite sex. \n\nMeanwhile, WPC Shaz Granger, feeling let down by the force, has handed in her notice. However, Gene manages to persuade her to take on one final operation and go undercover to catch the man they believe is the killer. But as Shaz puts herself in the firing line it seems this may be her last sting in more ways than one...\n\nAlso, Alex is still working to discover the truth behind Sam Tyler's death after her tip off from Jim Keats that Gene had something to do with it. But when Gene discovers what she's up to he can't help but intervene.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/ashestoashes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/ashestoashes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1008108/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1008108/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRipped by myself from bbciplayer HD***, protection and copywrite removed!!\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nTam&amp;Carla\n\n***Edit - This was actually from standard bbciplayer, not HD!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59e38cfae5660926ac4869abc128e0d40aed3712","amp;dn":"Ashes+to+Ashes_S03E02_HDTVRip_Tam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59e38cfae5660926ac4869abc128e0d40aed3712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,227,140,250,229,102,9,38,172,72,105,171,193,40,224,212,10,237,55,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
