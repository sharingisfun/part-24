Ay Fond Kiss (3:19)\n\n\n\nReview\nFairground Attraction's recording career was short and sweet: following the truly classic and phenomenal platinum seller `First of a Million Kisses' in 1988, the band's songwriter and artistic inspiration, Mark Nevin, left the band in the middle of recording the second album.\n\n`Ay Fond Kiss' was put out by RCA in 1990 in the wake of the band's demise. It basically consists of `B-side material' and FA's studio recordings of various covers, plus a sensational live-performance of `Hallelujah', probably FA's best-ever song.\n\nUnexpectedly the album is very, very good, runs FoaMK close, and is in no way second-best. From a rendition of Sam Cooke's `You Send Me' to jazz numbers `This Game of Love' and `Walking After Midnight' it's full of polished, tight, joyous music that will make you want to get up and dance.\n\nOnly one or two numbers (maybe `Cajun Band' and `Watching the Party') fall short of excellence. It's great to hear Eddi Reader singing in full-blooded Scottish dialect: both the opener `Jock O'Hazeldean' and the wonderful, virtually unaccompanied closer `Ay Fond Kiss' - a poem by the great Robbie Burns here set to music and sung with power, depth and conviction - are fine examples, the latter a high-point in FA' s recordings. If you've never heard this title track please give it a listen, and you might appreciate how good a singer Reader can be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4bb99d58b86000a0f982ce2e6e46283aac886a6","amp;dn":"Fairground+Attraction+-+Ay+fond+kiss+%5B1990%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4bb99d58b86000a0f982ce2e6e46283aac886a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,187,153,213,139,134,0,10,15,152,44,226,230,228,98,131,170,200,134,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
