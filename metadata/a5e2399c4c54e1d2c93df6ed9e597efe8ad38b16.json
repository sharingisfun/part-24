Four of the tracks (&quot;Where Do the Children Play?&quot;, &quot;On the Road to Find Out&quot;, &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot;, and &quot;Miles from Nowhere&quot;) were featured in the Hal Ashby and Colin Higgins' black comedy film Harold and Maude, in 1971. The track &quot;But I Might Die Tonight&quot; was featured in a film the year before, in 1970: Deep End, directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. Stevens, a former art student, created the artwork featured on the record's cover. &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; was also used over the end credits for the BBC TV show Extras.\n      With &quot;Wild World&quot; as an advance single, this was the album that brought Stevens world-wide fame. The album itself charted into the top 10 in the United States, where he had previously had few listeners. On 18 November 2003, Rolling Stone included this album in its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list at number 206. In 2006, the album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2007, the album was included in the list of &quot;The Definitive 200 Albums of All Time&quot;, released by The National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\n\n\n                        bonus\n\n\n         RARE BIRD  -  Sympathy  (1970)  (+)\n\n\n   (+)  =  This item has already been uploaded - part  093 \n   Replace the old file with this one\n   (new one is VOB format)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5e2399c4c54e1d2c93df6ed9e597efe8ad38b16","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+516","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5e2399c4c54e1d2c93df6ed9e597efe8ad38b16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,226,57,156,76,84,225,210,201,61,246,237,158,89,126,254,138,211,139,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
