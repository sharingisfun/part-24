Nastos\n\nAnat Cohen's sixth recording as a leader has her leading an all-star quartet in\nperformance on a Sunday evening at the Village Vanguard in New York City during\nthe centennial celebration of Benny Goodman. Appropriately, the clarinetist\nplays standards associated with the vaunted King of Swing, stretching the sound\nof her horn in extended versions of classic jazz with her own personal, tart,\nsweet flair. Pianist Benny Green, bassist Peter Washington, and drummer Lewis\nNash are more than up to the task of supporting Cohen without any grandstanding\nwhatsoever. The band is quite capable of fast, loose tempos as demonstrated\nduring &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown,&quot; &quot;What a Little Moonlight Can Do,&quot; and especially\n&quot;After You've Gone&quot; which is generally heard much slower and somberly. Cohen's\nmodern inclinations set her aside from Goodman on the sexy &quot;St. James\nInfirmary,&quot; but she's also very respectful of tradition on ballads,\nblues-oriented tunes, and the unforced, easy swing of &quot;St. Louis Blues.&quot; Solid\nif not unspectacular in the main, expressive for sure, Anat Cohen takes another\nunexpected turn in her burgeoning career with a traditional, vintage effort that\nmay very well surprise her fans, and certainly please the older set.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10bcaaae4b8cf16a31875ded843e74fa66af2687","amp;dn":"Anat+Cohen+-+Clarinetwork+Live+At+The+Village+Vanguard+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10bcaaae4b8cf16a31875ded843e74fa66af2687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,188,170,174,75,140,241,106,49,135,93,237,132,62,116,250,102,175,38,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
