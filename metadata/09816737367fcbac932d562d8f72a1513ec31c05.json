Added support for file sizes stored in binary format in TAR archives.\n     Some TAR archives use the binary size format instead of octal\n     for files larger than 8 GB.\n  \n  2. Bugs fixed:\n\n     a) &quot;Repair&quot; command failed to properly reconstruct structure\n        of RAR archives, which contained at least one file with packed\n        size exceeding 4 GB.\n\n        This bug did not affect the recovery record based repair.\n        It happened only if recovery record was not found and WinRAR\n        performed reconstruction of archive structure;\n\n     b) even if &quot;Do not extract paths&quot; option in &quot;Advanced&quot; part of\n        extraction dialog was set as the default, WinRAR still unpacked\n        file paths if called from Explorer context menu;\n\n     c) after entering a wrong password for encrypted ZIP archive,\n        sometimes WinRAR ignored subsequent attempts to enter a valid\n        password;\n\n     d) &quot;Wizard&quot; command did not allow to create self-extracting \n        and multivolume archives, when compressing a single folder\n        or a file without extension;\n\n     e) &quot;Import settings from file&quot; command did not restore multiline\n        comments in WinRAR compression profiles;\n\n     f) when converting RAR volumes having name1.name2.part#.rar name format,\n        &quot;Convert archives&quot; command erroneously removed &quot;.name2&quot; name part.\n        So resulting archive had name1.rar file name instead of expected\n        name1.name2.rar;\n\n     g) RAR could crash when creating a new archive with -agNNN switch\n        if archive number in generated name was 110 or larger.\n\nInstallation Instructions:\nINSTALL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09816737367fcbac932d562d8f72a1513ec31c05","amp;dn":"WinRar.4.01.Beta1.English.32.64.bits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09816737367fcbac932d562d8f72a1513ec31c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,129,103,55,54,127,203,172,147,45,86,45,143,114,161,81,62,195,28,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
