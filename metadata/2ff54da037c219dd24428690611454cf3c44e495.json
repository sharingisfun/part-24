Jim Alfredson, while touched by the style of Jimmy Smith, plays music that falls roughly halfway between soul-jazz and funk.\n\nOrganissimo's sound is infusing elements of funk, gospel, blues, progressive rock, and Latin rhythms into a solid foundation of jazz. Shifting meters, deep grooves, melodic finesse and tight ensemble interplay are hallmarks of the Organissimo sound.\n\nOrganissimo's music has received numerous local and national awards.\n\n\nList of included albums:\n\n2003 Waiting For The Boogaloo Sisters\n2005 This Is The Place\n2010 Alive And Kickin'!\n2013 Dedicated\n\n----------\n\nMP3 format. All songs are tagged by the book.\n\nIf you encounter errors during the file sharing, please, place this material as close to the root of the hard disk as possible and restart the file sharing (e.g. as close as possible to C: in Windows).

Operating systems have limits regarding how long a path including the filename can be, and if this limit is exceeded there will be errors.\n\n--------\n\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ.\n\n--------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ff54da037c219dd24428690611454cf3c44e495","amp;dn":"Organissimo+-+4+Albums+-+Jazz+Organ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ff54da037c219dd24428690611454cf3c44e495","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,245,77,160,55,194,25,221,36,66,134,144,97,20,84,207,60,68,228,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
