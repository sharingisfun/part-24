As a storm approaches the circus, the circus strongman finds out Oscar has flirted with his wife and attacks him. Oscar escapes in a hot air balloon, but is sucked into a tornado. The cyclone brings him to the Land of Oz where he is found by the witch Theodora. Theodora believes him to be a wizard prophesied to defeat the Wicked Witch who killed the king of Oz and take his place as ruler. En route to the capital of Oz, the Emerald City, Theodora falls in love with Oscar, who rebuffs such commitment to her. They also encounter a flying monkey named Finley, who pledges a life debt to Oscar when the latter saves him from a lion.\n\nOscar reaches the Emerald City where he meets Evanora, Theodora's sister. Evanora is skeptical of Oscar being the foretold wizard, but claims he can have all the power and wealth of the king if he goes to the Dark Forest and kills the Wicked Witch by destroying her wand, the source of her power. Oscar and Finley are joined en route by China Girl, a young, living china doll left orphaned after the Wicked Witch destroyed her home. The trio reach the Dark Forest and discover the &quot;Wicked Witch&quot; to be Glinda the Good Witch, who tells them Evanora is the true Wicked Witch. Evanora sees this with her crystal ball and manipulates Theodora against Oscar by showing him together with Glinda, saying he is trying to court all three witches. She then offers the heartbroken Theodora a magic apple she promises will remove her heartache, which Theodora eats, transforming her into a heartless, green-skinned Wicked Witch.\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a515f6602b7afdc65f3361eb119526ff0fa3687","amp;dn":"Oz+The+Great+And+Powerful.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a515f6602b7afdc65f3361eb119526ff0fa3687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,81,95,102,2,183,175,220,101,243,54,30,177,25,82,111,240,250,54,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
