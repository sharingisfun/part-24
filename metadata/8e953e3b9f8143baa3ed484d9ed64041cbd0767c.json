I'm Casey Kasem.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThere is a new band called Van Halen. Their debut hit &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; is at number 38.\n\nA listener wants to know when Billboard's National Disco Chart began and who held the very first number one spot in the survey. It's an act that has 2 top 10 hits in this countdown.\n\nThere is a band whose biggest obstacle to success was the name they chose.\n\nThe man who had the number one album on the very first album chart Billboard ever printed back in 1945 has a daughter in this countdown.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Has there ever been a year since the British invasion when no English acts hit number 1 on the American chart?&quot; It happened once, and Casey tells about it.\n\nCasey tells about the all-male American group that has had more number one hits than any other.\n\nThere are songs in this countdown from a double album that, for the 3 weeks prior to March 11th of '78, was selling a mind-blowing 200,000 copies a day!\n\n40:    ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s You That I Need - Enchantment\n39:    Never Have To Say Goodbye Ã¢â‚¬â€œ England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley\n38:    You Really Got Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Van Halen        \n37:    RunninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ On Empty Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jackson Browne     \n36:    Thank You For Being A Friend Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Andrew Gold     \n35:    Hot Legs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rod Stewart    \n34:    Lady Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lou Rawls\n33:    Before My Heart Finds Out Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gene Cotton\n32:    Sweet Talking Woman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Electric Light Orchestra\n31:    Poor Poor Pitiful Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Linda Ronstadt\n30:    Flashlight - Parliament\n29:    Which Way Is Up - Stargard    \n28:    Goodbye Girl Ã¢â‚¬â€œ David Gates\n27:    Theme From Close Encounters Of The Third Kind Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Williams\n26:    We Are The Champions - Queen\n25:    Dust In The Wind - Kansas\n24:    Ebony Eyes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bob Welch\n23:    Always &amp; Forever - Heatwave\n22:    Jack &amp; Jill - Raydio\n21:    If I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Have You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Yvonne Elliman\n20:    The Way You Do The Things You Do Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rita Coolidge\n19:    Our Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Natalie Cole\n18:    Wonderful World Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Art Garfunkel with James Taylor &amp; Paul Simon\n17:    Falling Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Leblanc &amp; Carr\n16:    Happy Anniversary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Little River Band\n15:    How Deep Is Your Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Bee Gees\n14:    Thunder Island Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jay Ferguson\n13:    WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Your Name Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lynyrd Skynyrd\n12:    Name Of The Game - Abba\n11:    Peg Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Steely Dan\n10:    CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Smile Without You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Barry Manilow\n9:    Just The Way You Are Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Billy Joel\n8:    I Go Crazy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Davis\n7:    Dance, Dance, Dance, Yowsah, Yowsah - Chic\n6:    StayinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Alive Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Bee Gees\n5:    Lay Down Sally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eric Clapton\n4:    Emotion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Samantha Sang\n3:    Sometimes When We Touch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dan Hill\n2:    Night Fever Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Bee Gees\n1:    Love Is Thicker Than Water Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Andy Gibb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e953e3b9f8143baa3ed484d9ed64041cbd0767c","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_March_11th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e953e3b9f8143baa3ed484d9ed64041cbd0767c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,149,62,59,159,129,67,186,163,237,72,77,158,214,64,65,203,208,118,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
