Effy is worried, but she is  \n                    assured that so long as she is disciplined she  \n                    will be ok. Her life is now dictated by routine  \n                    and self-control. Anthea has completely cleared  \n                    out her room so there's no evidence of the old  \n                    Effy remaining. She appears happy, clear and  \n                    hopeful for the future. She goes to visit  \n                    Freddie and tries to pick up where they left  \n                    off, but it's not that easy now that she has to  \n                    live life by the strict routines she has set  \n                    herself. Freddie and Anthea become concerned  \n                    about her, she's stronger and more self-assured  \n                    than ever, but something isn't right.    \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                    Due to technical problems we are unable to cap\n                    encrypted channels at the moment.
