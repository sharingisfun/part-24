Moreover, the available \ndata on performance, service ability, availability of free space and fragmentation \nof each section. It should be noted that the program is minimized in the system \ntray, where the indexed disk activity. In HDD Observer is a system of notification\nfor the specified criteria. For example, the program alerts the user when the \namount of free space reaches a critical level, or in case of equipment failure. \n\nIn the utility built four instruments (Disk Cleaner, Disk Defragmenter, Registry \nCleaner, Registry Defragmenter). With their help, the Windows operating system \nand hard disk drives are maintained.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n- Low memory.\n- Support command line.\n- Simple and intuitive interface.\n- Checking file system and registry.\n- Defragmentation and disk scrubbing, and the registry.\n- Display information about the activity of hard disks in the system tray.\n- Disk Utilities : a tool for creating partitions, convert FAT to NTFS, \n  the signature verification files, creating self-extracting files, \n  creating archives, and CAB, etc.\n\n\nHDD Observer is not only a High Technologic Product - it is one of the most \nintelligent soft for hard drives monitoring.

One of them \nis SmartBehavior - a Unique Technology Implemented in behavior monitoring tools.\nFor Example, if HDD temperature is near its critical value then HDD Observer \nbegins to check it more frequently to exactly detect the time When the temperature\nwill reach its critical value. \nEvident - if critical value is reached, then HDD Observer will check HDDs with \na lower frequency to release any system resources.\n\nAnother interesting feature is 'System Fragmentation Monitoring':\nHDD Observer begins fragmentation check only when the computer is idle, and all \nsystem resources are free. In this case HDD Observer will check for fragmentation \nuntil it will finish or the user will need any system resources. After check it \ninforms the user about fragmentation level and can even defragment HD using its \nbuild-in defragmentation tools.\n\nThese and many other features make HDD Observer the most advanced HDD troubles \nmonitoring and repairing program.\n \n \n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n- Windows XP/2003/Vista compatible\n- Native 64 bit support for best performance\n- .NET Framework 2.0\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.daoisoft.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.daoisoft.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my TPB account:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security \n2- Avira AntiVir Premium \n3- avast! Pro Antivirus\n4- Kaspersky Antivirus\n\nAlso scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected \nby other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at May 17, 2010 - 00.10 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35bf241de7e48538d9bfb3ab7e5b7945c8547946","amp;dn":"Daoisoft+HDD+Observer+v3.9.2+Pro+%2B+Crack+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35bf241de7e48538d9bfb3ab7e5b7945c8547946","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,191,36,29,231,228,133,56,217,191,179,171,126,91,121,69,200,84,121,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
