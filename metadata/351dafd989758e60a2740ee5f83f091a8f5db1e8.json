A summer favourite of mine. Enjoy!\n\nBrought to you by TQMP\nThe Quality Music Project\n\nBrazil is vast ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as big as Australia, Spain and France combined. Large enough to spawn a whole slew of road movies and, so it would appear, road albums too. Otto's Sem Gravidade is one example, as is this gorgeous CD, born from a journey Beto Villares undertook to research music for a documentary. Setting the mood for the musical voyage he wishes to share with us, he reels off names of Brazilian cities. 'Teresina, Petrolina, HorizonteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦' he sings on the opening track, accompanied by Fernanda Takai of Pato Fu. 'Meio Dia em Macapa' recalls the midday heat in Amapa's capital; 'Redentor' remembers Rio; and 'Africa La' hymns the Afro-Brazilian heart of the north-east. \n\nThe overall style recalls CeU's 'Malemolencia' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ spacey, clubby and drifty, with echoes of bossa nova, samba, forro and baiao picked up with an eclectic, post-genre ear to the world. There are plenty of guests on board. Alongside Villares' own baritone, there's CeU's sweet huskiness, the MPB touch of Zelia Duncan of (new) Os Mutantes, a rapping Rappin' Hood and the rich contralto of Anelis Assumpcao. The latter's seductive, pure voice closes the album with perhaps the strongest track, 'Lume'. She's the daughter of the founder of the Sao Paulo avant-garde, Itamar Assumpcao, and his musical stamp is felt all over the CD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from the tight three-point harmony and offbeat bass of 'No Dend'agua' to the quirky rhythms of the vocal lines in 'Medo'.\n\nThis is a wonderful debut: modern yet rooted in traditional Brazil, richer and more detailed on every listen.\n-- SongLines Magazine\n\n&quot;Villares sends his inspirations spinning into exciting new territories&quot;\n-- Metro, UK\n\n&quot;Downbeat, seamlessly woven blend... early contender for summer chill-out classic&quot;\n-- Observer, UK\n\nTracks\n01- Incerteza\n02- Excelentes Lugares Bonitos\n03- Rio da Bossa Nova\n04- No Dend'Agua\n05- Aboio\n06- Nacao Postal\n07- Um Dia Desses\n08- Meio Dia Em Macapa\n09- Redentor\n10- Africa LaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â \n11- Santo Negro\n12- Festa Na Roca\n13- Medo\n14- Pra Acabar\n15- Lume\n\nEAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nAudio format: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:351dafd989758e60a2740ee5f83f091a8f5db1e8","amp;dn":"Beto+Villares+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"351dafd989758e60a2740ee5f83f091a8f5db1e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,29,175,217,137,117,142,96,162,116,14,229,248,63,9,26,143,93,177,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
