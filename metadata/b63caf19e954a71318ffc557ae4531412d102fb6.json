So Good 04:51\n\nBiography by Ron Wynn\n\nThough stardom has evaded her, English vocalist Mica Paris has a wonderful voice and individualistic delivery and approach. She sang in the Spirit\nof Watts gospel group before touring and recording in the late &amp;#039;80s with Hollywood Beyond. She signed with 4th and Broadway/Island in the &amp;#039;80s and then issued her debut So Good. Her second LP, Contribution, was released in 1990. Paris moved to Polydor for her third LP, Whisper a Prayer, in 1993. She also recorded with Will Downing in 1989, doing an updated version of &quot;Where Is the Love.&quot;\n\nReview by Alex Henderson\n\nA gospel-influenced soul/pop singer with a fine range and a quality not unlike Natalie Cole, Mica Paris is among the many noteworthy talents to come out of Britain&amp;#039;s healthy R&amp;B scene of the 1980s and &amp;#039;90s. Though not a remarkable effort, her debut album, So Good, was a respectable and decent one indicating that she had much potential. Among the CD&amp;#039;s more noteworthy cuts are the haunting &quot;My One Temptation,&quot; the jazz-influenced &quot;Sway (Dance the Blues Away)&quot; and the sizzling &quot;Nothing Hits Your Heart like Soul Music&quot; (which also seems like a statement of purpose, and points to Paris&amp;#039; devotion to more traditional R&amp;B elements). Perhaps the song that does the most to test what Paris is truly made of is &quot;Where Is the Love&quot; -- forming a duet with Will Downing for this remake of the Roberta Flack/Donny Hathaway classic, the earthy singer makes it crystal clear that she&amp;#039;s quite capable of depth. For Paris, the best was yet to come.\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b63caf19e954a71318ffc557ae4531412d102fb6","amp;dn":"Mica+Paris+-+So+Good+-+%281988%29%5BFLAC-EAC-CUE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b63caf19e954a71318ffc557ae4531412d102fb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,60,175,25,233,84,167,19,24,255,197,87,174,69,49,65,45,16,47,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
