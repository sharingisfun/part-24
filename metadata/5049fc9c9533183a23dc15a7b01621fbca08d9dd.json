However, all three sides find themselves working together when Mike Morningstar, now going by Darkstar, captures all but Gwen to feed his powers. With the help of the DNAliens, Gwen frees her friends and Mike is captured while the Highbreed Lord and the DNAliens escape. In gratitude, Magister Ghilhil makes the team Honorary Plumbers so they can defend the Earth legally and help the world.\n\n202 - Alone Together\nAfter an accident with a teleporter pod, Ben and a Highbreed Commander named Reinrassic III are stranded on a desert planet that acts as a routing station for the teleporter. The pair are forced to work together to fend off the dangerous predators on the planet while making their way to the routing station, much to Reinrassic's chagrin. As they make their way across the desert, the two save each other from danger several times, even risking their own lives to do so. After reaching the teleporter pod, Reinrassic III stays behind, having deemed himself contaminated by Ben and thus a risk to the purity of his species.\n\n203 - Good Copy, Bad Copy\nA Galvan (the race that created the Omnitrix and gave Ben the form of Grey Matter) named Albedo builds his own Omnitrix and is permanently stuck in Ben's human form (since wearing the Omnitrix, Ben's DNA has become a default in the Omnitrix, according to Albedo). Now, because they share DNA, they can change into the same forms as each other. Azmuth comes after both Ben and Albedo's Omnitrixes become attached, permanently damaging Albedo's human form. Azmuth removes the face plate of Albedo's Omnitrix, ensuring his human form is both a punishment and a prison for proving himself as a lesser being. Albedo is teleported to a Plumber prison while Azmuth says to Ben that he was the one to use the Omnitrix for good, not evil.\n\n204 - Save the Last Dance\nGwen forces Kevin to take her to her school's dance, forcing a clueless Kevin to seek advice from Ben. However, Ben has his own problems, as Big Chill takes over his body with each transformation and starts trying to eat every metal object in sight. Joined by Julie, Gwen and Kevin manage to subdue Big Chill, only to discover that Big Chill was only building a nest for eggs he had laid. The eggs hatch into infant Necrofriggians, and Kevin teases Ben about being a &quot;mother.&quot; Julie takes Ben home on her scooter, while Gwen and Kevin miss the dance, and decide to dance to the music in Kevin's car.\n\n205 - Undercover\nKevin, Gwen, and Ben destroy a teleporter they were working on and need help repairing it. Kevin suggests Cooper, the young boy who had helped the Tennysons in the past (who also happens to have a huge crush on Gwen). Unfortunately, Cooper has been kidnapped by the DNAliens. They track him to the abandoned military base where Paradox built his time machine. They discover that the Highbreed have erected a cloaking field, built by Cooper over the area, concealing a mysterious arch-like device. They free Cooper and have him destroy the cloaking generator, during which he has visions of the arch acting as a gateway for a fleet of ships and the Earth being destroyed. Despite destroying the generator, the Highbreed manage to repair it and continue their operations unhindered.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease share....Don't hit and run...Seed it back at least once.\n\nOf course, if you want to seed it back more than once, that would be ok too :)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5049fc9c9533183a23dc15a7b01621fbca08d9dd","amp;dn":"Ben+10%3A+Alien+Force+-+Volume+4+%282009%29+DVDRip+Eng+Xvid+AC3+AVI+%5BB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5049fc9c9533183a23dc15a7b01621fbca08d9dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,73,252,156,149,51,24,58,35,220,21,167,176,22,33,251,202,8,217,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
