Building on the strengths of Chapman's original text, this long-awaited 5th edition has been revised and expanded by a team of eminent insect physiologists, bringing it fully up-to-date for the molecular era. The chapters retain the successful structure of the earlier editions, focusing on particular functional systems rather than taxonomic groups and making it easy for students to delve into topics without extensive knowledge of taxonomy. The focus is on form and function, bringing together basic anatomy and physiology and examining how these relate to behaviour. This, combined with nearly 600 clear illustrations, provides a comprehensive understanding of how insects work. Now also featuring a richly illustrated prologue by George McGavin, this is an essential text for students, researchers and applied entomologists alike.\n\nAbout the Author\nR. F. Chapman (1930 2003) was an eminent insect physiologist and Professor in the Division of Neurobiology at the University of Arizona. His first four editions of The Insects have formed the standard text in the field for more than forty years.\n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\nList of contributors ix\nPreface xi\nAcknowledgments xii\nPrologue xiii\nPart I The head, ingestion, utilization and distribution of food\nPart II The thorax and locomotion\nPart III The abdomen, reproduction and development\nPart IV The integument, gas exchange and homeostasis\nPart V Communication\n A Physiological coordination within the insect\n B Perception of the environment\n C Communication with other organisms\nIndex 901","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7daabf9a3991b4d0513e12a42dc9a05390e8242","amp;dn":"The+Insects+-+Structure+and+Function+%285th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7daabf9a3991b4d0513e12a42dc9a05390e8242","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,218,171,249,163,153,27,77,5,19,225,42,66,220,154,5,57,14,130,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
