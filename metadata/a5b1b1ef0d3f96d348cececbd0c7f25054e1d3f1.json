With a bevy of new and exclusive tunes littering their selection including Jump Jump Dance Dance, Placebo, Meck feat. Dino, Bob Sinclar, Chris Sorbello and more - the Stafford boys once again unleash some serious fire for your ears.\n\nTriumphantly returning to the Sessions series after a monster mix for the 2009 edition, local hero Tommy Trash has this time wrapped his mixing fingers around Disc 2, capping off an enormous twelve months that have seen the Sydney noisemaker hit the big time with his headline grabbing single Need Me To Stay and logging in big sets at events like the New Years Day debut of Space Ibiza. TommyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mix truly offers up something for everyone with the ambitious DJ throwing a thousand kitchen sinks into his mix, fusing house, electro and even indie dance into one streamlined party disc with tracks from Wiley, Passion Pit, Yolanda be Cool, Vandalism, Fedde Le Grand, Afrojack, Two Door Cinema club and more.\n\nTaking the reins for the grand finale of Sessions Seven is none other than Steve Aoki, Los AngelesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ enduring DJ supremo and the mastermind behind the Dim Mak arena at the 2010 We Love Sounds and Winter Sound System festivals. Bringing his shiny Hollywood stamp to proceedings on Disc 3, Aoki throws down all manner of mayhem with his mix, with choice cuts from Dim Mak brethren The Bloody Beetroots wedged alongside AustraliaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own The Aston Shuffle, The Only, Kissy Sell Out and even the snarling gutter-punk of Rifoki, Steve Aoki ends this party the only way he knows how; with the roof torn off and the cops called in to break up a riot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5b1b1ef0d3f96d348cececbd0c7f25054e1d3f1","amp;dn":"Ministry+of+Sound+-+Sessions+Seven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5b1b1ef0d3f96d348cececbd0c7f25054e1d3f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,177,177,239,13,63,150,211,72,206,206,203,208,199,242,80,84,225,211,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
