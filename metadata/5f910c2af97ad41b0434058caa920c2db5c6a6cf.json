The second installment of his Berlin Trilogy with Brian Eno (the other releases being Low and Lodger) &quot;Heroes&quot; developed further the sound of Low. Of the three albums, it was the only one wholly recorded in Berlin. The title track remains one of Bowie's best known, a classic story of two lovers who meet at the Berlin Wall. The album is considered one of his best by critics, notably for the contributions of guitarist Robert Fripp who flew in from the US to record his parts in one day. It was named NME Album of the Year. \n\nPersonnel : \n\nDavid Bowie   Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, keyboards, guitars, saxophone, koto, backing vocals \nCarlos Alomar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitar \nDennis Davis  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion \nGeorge Murray Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar \nBrian Eno     Ã¢â‚¬â€œ synthesisers, keyboards, guitar treatments \nRobert Fripp  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar \nTony Visconti Ã¢â‚¬â€œ backing vocals \nAntonia Maass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ backing vocals \n\n\nArtists:......-David Bowie \nAlbum Name:...-Heroes \nFormat:.......-MP3 \nSize:.........-93MB \nTracks:.......-10 \nGenre:........-Art rock , Experimental rock \nLength:.......-40:36 \nCountry:......-UK\n\nImages :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/album/qv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/album/qv&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSEED :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/RA8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/RA8&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f910c2af97ad41b0434058caa920c2db5c6a6cf","amp;dn":"+David+Bowie+-+Heroes+%281977+%29+%5B+mp3+320kpbs+%5D+-+Freak37","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f910c2af97ad41b0434058caa920c2db5c6a6cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,145,12,42,249,122,212,27,4,52,5,140,170,146,12,45,181,198,166,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
