Electromagnetic transients simulation (EMTS) has become a universal tool for the analysis of power system electromagnetic transients in the range of nanoseconds to seconds. This book provides a thorough review of EMTS and many simple examples are included to clarify difficult concepts. This book will be of particular value to advanced engineering students and practising power systems engineers.
