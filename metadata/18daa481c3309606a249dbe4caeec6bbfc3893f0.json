This is a scanner of Alex's guitar only.  Occasionally a small amount of bleed through will occur and you might catch a hint of another instrument or perhaps some of the prerecorded tracks but 99.99% of this is guitar only.  Listening to this recording it gave me a new &quot;perspective&quot; of Alex's playing thus the name.  From a production standpoint, it was sort of odd to do.  For example there are stretches were Alex may not play for several minutes (during the &quot;Hello St Louis&quot; section for example). This mostly happens between songs but not always.  What I tried to do was cut out the &quot;dead air&quot; but leave in at least 3 seconds or so between songs.  What I did not do was cut out this dead air during a song, for example Closer to the Heart has about 23 seconds of dead air in the middle of it.  That stayed.  It's mostly complete but we are missing part of Force Ten and a bit of Superconductor. Even though there is the occasional static this is perhaps the best sounding scanner of Alex only currently available. Enjoy!\n\nThanks goes out to Neph for the artwork.  How he finds the time only he knows!\n\nThis recording was produced by fans, for fans and is never to be sold. If you like this recording, support the artists and purchase their official releases!
