On stage, Donna is unapologetically herself, joking about topics as intimate as her sex life and as crude as her day-old underwear. But when Donna winds up unexpectedly pregnant after a one-night stand, she is forced to face the uncomfortable realities of independent womanhood for the first time. Donna's drunken hookup - and epic lapse in prophylactic judgment - turns out to be the beginning of a hilarious and totally unplanned journey of self-discovery and empowerment.\n\nStars: Jenny Slate, Jake Lacy, Gaby Hoffmann\n\n\nSNAPSHOTS http://bayimg.com/haAoCaAGo\n\n---------------\n\nSample included\n\n---------------\n\n\nTrailer and Clip  \n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy !\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0594865fb0709d26c44cb12b9a2108c247fcc214","amp;dn":"Obvious.Child.2014.BDrip.Avi-OmiTube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0594865fb0709d26c44cb12b9a2108c247fcc214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,148,134,95,176,112,157,38,196,76,177,43,154,33,8,194,71,252,194,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
