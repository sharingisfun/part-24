Robertson &quot;Food Packaging and Shelf Life: A Practical Guide&quot;\n1 edition (December 21, 2009) | 404 Pages | ISBN: 1420078445 | PDF | 4,9 MB\n\nDemonstrates the Nexus between Packaging &amp; Shelf Life\nThe importance of packaging hardly needs stressing since only a handful of foods are sold in an unpackaged state. With an increasing focus on sustainability and cost-effectiveness, responsible companies no longer want to over-package their food products, yet many remain unsure just where reductions can effectively be made. Food Packaging and Shelf Life: A Practical Guide provides package developers with the information they need to specify just the right amount of protective packaging to maintain food quality and maximize shelf life.\n32 Expert Contributors from 12 Different Countries\n\nCurrent food packaging must take into consideration the biochemical, chemical, physical, and biological changes that occur during processing, distribution, and storage. Organized according to chapters devoted to specific food products, this practical handbook defines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for the first time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the indices of failure for foods as diverse as milk, fruits, bottled water, juices, vegetables, fish, and beef. It discusses the deteriorative reactions for each and reviews how different packaging materials may influence time to failure and thus shelf life. Biobased packaging is examined in a separate chapter as is the impact of active packaging on shelf life. Packaging and the microbial shelf life of foods is the subject of another chapter, while a further chapter discusses shelf life testing methodology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4faec708e91dfde75be346d55442c236cd29e9b3","amp;dn":"Food+Packaging+and+Shelf+Life%3A+A+Practical+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4faec708e91dfde75be346d55442c236cd29e9b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,174,199,8,233,29,253,231,91,227,70,213,84,66,194,54,205,41,233,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
