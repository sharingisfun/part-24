New York Sketches features 15 full-color reproductions of the beautiful ink-and-watercolor drawings that Tomine began after moving from California to the city. Each shows his unparalleled eye for detail: a police officer scrutinizes a stylish young mother; a girl remains content but completely motionless through four subway stops; a disgruntled worker kicks a chair while he sweeps. It is the only full-color project featuring new art from Adrian Tomine, one of the most respected and perhaps the most widely visible alternative cartoonists of our time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8f0a09ab792e6282fc7ed082d11c5ca2ce90bb9","amp;dn":"Adrian+Tomine+-+New+York+Sketches+2004","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8f0a09ab792e6282fc7ed082d11c5ca2ce90bb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,240,160,154,183,146,230,40,47,199,237,8,45,17,197,202,44,233,11,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
