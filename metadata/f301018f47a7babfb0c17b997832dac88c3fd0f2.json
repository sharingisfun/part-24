Hagmann, the founder and director of the Northeast Intelligence Network.\n\n\nNOTE: The extended broadcast today ended at 5:00 p.m. and consisted largely of Jarkari Jackson and David Knight taking calls -- some interesting and some less so. I'm including with this upload a roughly half-hour segment from hour five that contains the Stewart Rhodes interview. The first minute or so is missing.
