In 1964, John Milner has changed little and still occupies his time with women and fast cars. In 1965, Terry the Toad, now a soldier, schemes to get out of Vietnam by faking an injury. In 1966, Debbie and Carol join the flower people in San Francisco. In 1967, now-married Steve and Laurie play out a domestic dispute while a riot breaks out at an anti-war rally.\n\nIt was a time of crisis, a time of war and social revolt. And it marked the end of an era of innocence for the group of friends who found themselves in the eye of the storm that was the 60's: Vietnam, Haight-Ashbury and the campus peace movement. A time when becoming an adult meant laughing, crying and savoring old friendships.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6d3d438d885be01ba348c25b66dd3f09da885f9","amp;dn":"More+American+Graffiti+Dvdrip+H264+Bookerdog.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6d3d438d885be01ba348c25b66dd3f09da885f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,211,212,56,216,133,190,1,186,52,140,37,182,109,211,240,157,168,133,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
