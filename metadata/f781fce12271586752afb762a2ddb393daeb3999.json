It was released on 17 May 1993 in the United Kingdom, 24 June 1993 in Japan and 10 August 1993 in the United States. The album features strong elements of the mixture of R&amp;B and funk genres, but it is notable for being one of the group's definitive acid-jazz albums.\n\n\nimage Review:\nJamiroquai made a large initial splash in 1993 with Emergency on Planet Earth, a psychedelic melange of tight funky rhythms, acid rock intimations, and '70s soul melodies. Frontman Jay Kay introduces himself with an environmentally oriented manifesto inside the sleeve, and his lyrics smack of idealist save the planet revolution. But this revolution would be held on the dancefloor if the band's impressive rhythm section had anything to say about it. Horns, string arrangements, and a didgeridoo provide full texture on most of the album's tunes, and the socially aware party vibe raged into the U.K.'s number one album slot. For a debut, Emergency shows quite a range of diversity, from the up-tempo jazzy instrumental &quot;Music of the Mind&quot; to the stop-start funk of &quot;Whatever It Is, I Just Can't Stop.&quot;\nReview by Troy Carpenter\n\n\nAlbum List:\n\nCD 1 - original album fully remastered\n01.
