Since that time, he has also found success as a songwriter with hits from Dwight Yoakam (&quot;AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t That Lonely Yet&quot;), Diamond Rio (&quot;In A Week Or Two&quot;) and Martina McBride (&quot;A Broken Wing&quot;), so hit songs and House go hand in hand. Still, the performer tells Billboard that he received a note in the fall of 2013 that threw him for a little bit of a loop.\n\n&quot;Back in November, I got an email from a fan who said Ã¢â‚¬ËœThis Is Me Missing YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is number one on the UK dance charts,&quot; he said with a hint of disbelief in his voice. &quot;My first thought was that somebody covered it. I emailed back and asked who cut it, and they said Ã¢â‚¬ËœNobody. It was our track.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ I investigated, and indeed it was number one.&quot; The success of the song made him think about the possibility of a new record Ã¢â‚¬â€œ something he hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done since 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Home, Vol. 1 EP. &quot;I thought if there was ever be a great time to do another record, this was it,&quot; he told The 615.\n\nThat project, &quot;Broken Glass, Twisted Steel,&quot; is out this week on HouseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own Victor House label. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a mixture of new material, along with a few songs that House has been waiting to put his stamp on for awhile.  &quot;IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been wanting to do this record for a long time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with my versions of Ã¢â‚¬ËœAinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t That Lonely Yet,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœIn A Week Or Two,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬ËœA Broken Wing.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ I also had some new stuff on the record as well that I wanted to cut. It was just a good time. I really enjoyed it.&quot;\n\nThe singer reflected on the success of &quot;A Broken Wing,&quot; a 1998 number one for McBride that has become one of her signature performances. &quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like an old friend,&quot; he said warmly. &quot;Somebody sang it the other night on 'The Voice,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and they did a great job on it. You write a lot of songs, and you figure that one in a hundred is going to be special. That happened to be that one,&quot; he said.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bced08d0e62c6519ee9a79fe123c9c06ff82f6c","amp;dn":"James+House+-+Broken+Glass+Twisted+Steel+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bced08d0e62c6519ee9a79fe123c9c06ff82f6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,206,208,141,14,98,198,81,158,233,167,159,225,35,201,192,111,248,47,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
