For this monumental achievement, a nearly three-year-long, bank-breaking production, Tati again thrust the endearingly clumsy, resolutely old-fashioned Monsieur Hulot, along with a host of other lost souls, into a bafflingly modernist Paris. With every inch of its superwide frame crammed with hilarity and inventiveness, Playtime is a lasting testament to a modern age tiptoeing on the edge of oblivion.\n\nEXTRAS\nVideo introduction by writer, director, and performer Terry Jones\nSelected scene commentary by film historian Philip Kemp\nAu-delÃƒÂ  de Ã¢â‚¬Å“Playtime,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a short documentary featuring behind-the-scenes footage from the production\nTati Story, a short biographical film\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Jacques Tati in Monsieur HulotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Work,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a 1976 BBC Omnibus program featuring Tati\nRare audio interview with Tati from the U.S. debut of Playtime at the 1972 San Francisco International Film Festival (Courtesy of Pacifica Radio Archives)\nVideo interview with script supervisor Sylvette Baudrot\nCours du soir, a 1967 short film written by and starring Tati\nAlternate international soundtrack\nNew and improved English subtitle translation\n\nUNTOUCHED DVD ISO/MDS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f4c3018b42157efaf24f1044e60e08bfddea91c","amp;dn":"PLAYTIME+CRITERION+COLLECTION+REISSUE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f4c3018b42157efaf24f1044e60e08bfddea91c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,76,48,24,180,33,87,239,175,36,241,4,78,96,224,139,253,222,169,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
