A 72-minute version was aired on television, and later re-edited as a 104-minute film for theatrical release. In 1999, Daniele Huillet and Jean-Marie Straub finished their film Sicilia!, based on a novel by Italian writer Elio Vittorini, a film which is relatively accessible compared to other works by the couple. They are talking about their new project with a group of students and the discussion immediately turns into a lesson about cinema. Pedro Costa decided to portray the two filmmakers during their workshop at the Studio National des Arts Contemporains. Daniele Huillet is in charge, Jean-Marie Straub measures the editing room with giant steps. Their dissertations are continually interwoven with theory and practice. They dicuss the meticulous work put into some sequences of their film. However, filming their work isnt enough; its also necessary to consider their thoughts, and the hesitations which interrupt the rhythm. When talking to the students, these are the elements which are the first to arise.\n\n[http://www.viennale.at/cgi-bin/viennale/archiv/film.pl?id=1807&amp;lang=en]\n\n\n\n\n\n********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ***********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
