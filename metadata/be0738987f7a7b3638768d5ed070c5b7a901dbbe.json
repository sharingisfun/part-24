They can't afford the $50K for an attorney so they   \n           call the lawyer cousin of one of the boys. Vinny is a         \n       stereotypical New Yorker who is initially a complete disaster,    \n                     but can he get them off the hook ?                  \n                                                                         \n     -                                                            \n   iNFO                                                            \n      \n                                                                         \n     This internal technically could be a &quot;PROPER&quot; but I couldn't find   \n     the sample from the FOCUS release from 2 years ago. Here is a rip   \n     with the correct AR, I'm not sure how 640x420 works for a movie     \n     that is 1.85 : 1, but enough ranting. Here it is done right, with   \n     AC3 and of course the AppeaL touch.
