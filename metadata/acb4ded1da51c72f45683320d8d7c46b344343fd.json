It covers economic (optimization) and environmental issues. The latest design strategies are described, most of which have been improved significantly with the advent of computers, mathematical programming methods, and artificial intelligence. Various methods are utilized to perform the extensive calculations and provide graphical results that are visualized easily, including the usage of computer programs for simulation and design optimization","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acb4ded1da51c72f45683320d8d7c46b344343fd","amp;dn":"Product+and+Process+Design+Principles+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acb4ded1da51c72f45683320d8d7c46b344343fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,180,222,209,218,81,199,47,69,104,51,32,216,215,196,107,52,67,67,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
