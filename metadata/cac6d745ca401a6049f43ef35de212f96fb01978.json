After Argentinian troops take control of the Falkland Islands, the British task force set sail with a heroes' send off. Robert Lawrence, an enthusiastic young officer in the Royal Scots Guards, watches jealously: as a professional soldier; he is itching to join the fray.\n\nFour months later, Robert is recuperating from a near fatal wound he received in the vital battle for Tumbledown, a peak overlooking Port Stanley. A sniper shot has blown away a large part of his brain and left him paralysed down his left side.\n\nBack home, Robert - a physical and emotional wreck - soon discovers a nation honouring the heroes of the war with memorial services and victory parades, is less keen to face the living victims. The authorities want him hidden away, his girlfriend leaves him and even his best friend fails to understand him.\n\nRaging at his treatment, visiting his old barracks, and reliving his experience on the battlefield, Robert desperately attempts to come to terms with both his disabilities and a perception of war that contradicts and ignores his own experience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cac6d745ca401a6049f43ef35de212f96fb01978","amp;dn":"TUMBLEDOWN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cac6d745ca401a6049f43ef35de212f96fb01978","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,198,215,69,202,64,26,96,73,244,62,243,93,226,18,249,111,176,25,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
