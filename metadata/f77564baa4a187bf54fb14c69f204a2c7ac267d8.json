Turn! Turn!&quot; was the third single by the American folk rock band The Byrds and was released on October 1, 1965 by Columbia Records. The song was also included on the band's second album, Turn! Turn! Turn!, which was released on December 6, 1965. The Byrds' single (b/w &quot;She Don't Care About Time&quot;) is the most successful recorded version of the song, having reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 charts and #26 on the UK Singles Chart. The Byrds' version distinguishes the song as the #1 pop hit with the oldest lyrics, dating back to the Book of Ecclesiastes. Many biblical scholars believe Ecclesiastes 1:1 implies King Solomon as the book's author; thus, if true, giving Solomon lyrical credit for a number one hit.\n\nThe song had first been arranged by The Byrds' lead guitarist Jim McGuinn in a chamber-folk style during sessions for Judy Collins' 1963 album, Judy Collins 3. The idea of reviving the song came to McGuinn during The Byrds' 1965 American tour when his future wife, Dolores, requested the tune on the Byrds' tour bus. The rendition that McGuinn dutifully played came out sounding not like a folk song but more like a rock/folk hybrid, perfectly in keeping with The Byrds' current status as pioneers of the folk rock genre. McGuinn explained &quot;It was a standard folk song by that time, but I played it and it came out rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll because thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what I was programmed to do like a computer. I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do it as it was traditionally. It came out with that samba beat, and we thought it would make a good single.&quot;\n\nThe master recording of the song reputedly took 78 takes, spread over five days of recording, to complete. The song's plea for peace and tolerance struck a nerve with the American record buying public as the Vietnam War continued to escalate. The single also solidified folk rock as a chart trend and, like the band's previous hits, continued The Byrds' successful mix of vocal harmony and jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar playing. During 1965 and 1966, the band performed the song on the television programs Hollywood A Go-Go, Shindig!, The Ed Sullivan Show, and Where the Action Is, as well as in the concert film, The Big T.N.T. Show. Additionally, the song would go on to become a staple of The Byrds' live concert repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973. The song was also performed live by a reformed line-up of The Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman in January 1989. In addition to its appearance on the Turn! Turn! Turn! album, the song also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including The Byrds' Greatest Hits, History of The Byrds, The Original Singles: 1965ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1967, Volume 1, The Byrds, 20 Essential Tracks from the Byrds Box Set (1965-1990), The Very Best of The Byrds, The Essential Byrds and There Is a Season.\n\nNearly three decades after the Byrds released the song as a single, the recording was featured prominently in the 1994 movie Forrest Gump. The song was also featured in Jim Sheridan's 2002 film, In America, although it was not included on the official soundtrack. Following Joe Cocker's cover of &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, the song was the first to play on the first episode of the television series The Wonder Years. It was also used in a Wonder Years parody, during The Simpsons' episode, &quot;Three Men and a Comic Book&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77564baa4a187bf54fb14c69f204a2c7ac267d8","amp;dn":"The+Byrds-Turn+%21+Turn+%21+Turn%21%28Soundtrack%3A+Forrest+Gump%29%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77564baa4a187bf54fb14c69f204a2c7ac267d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,117,100,186,164,161,135,191,84,251,20,198,159,32,74,44,122,194,103,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
