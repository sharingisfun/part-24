Clad in black leather jackets and with their hair greased back in ducktails, they performed punchy '50s rock classics at a time when ten-minute guitar solos were de rigueur.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/flash-cadillac-p17562/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/flash-cadillac-p17562/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by James A. Gardner):\n\nFor their third album, Flash Cadillac masterfully recreates the breezy California pop of the mid-'60s. Beach Boys comparisons are inevitable, especially given that they open the album with an expert cover of &quot;Summer Means Fun,&quot; originally recorded by Bruce Johnston, a Beach Boy himself, and sometime Beach Boy producer Terry Melcher. They also manage two satisfying Beach Boys homages with the original (Kris Moe) compositions that follow it, &quot;Time Will Tell&quot; and &quot;It's a Summer Night.&quot; &quot;It's a Summer Night&quot; may be the pinnacle of Flash Cadillac's recording career, with outstanding vocal and instrumental work by the group set against flawless '60s production values. Two tracks by Hondell Richard Burns -- the oldie &quot;Come On, Let's Go&quot; and a new song, &quot;Good Times, Rock &amp; Roll&quot; -- fit into the program nicely. Another Moe original, &quot;I Wish You'd Dance,&quot; brings some sparkle to the album's second side, but &quot;It's Hard (To Break the Ice)&quot; is bland, and the closing &quot;Rock and Roll Menace&quot; is pointless and dull. With a few more top-quality tunes, this album could have been a 10. As it is, Sons of the Beaches is a refreshing, well-executed evocation of a golden age of pop songwriting and record making.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/sons-of-the-beaches-r37699/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/sons-of-the-beaches-r37699/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004U16R&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004U16R&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
