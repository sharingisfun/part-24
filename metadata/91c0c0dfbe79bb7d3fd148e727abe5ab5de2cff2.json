He quit the force a few years ago to play poker for a living and has been losing steadily for months. His money is running out - and so is his live-in girlfriend.\n\nAfter one of Snow's poker buddies - a real estate investor and landlord who worked as a clown - is found shot to death in his home following their weekly game, Snow finds himself under suspicion by his former Metro Homicide partner, Marcia Stevens.\n\nAt forty-four, Snow is in the worst mess of his life. He's not sure what to do, who to turn to, or who to trust as he scrambles to stay one step ahead of an arrest warrant for first-degree murder.\n\nSmart and tightly plotted, Snow Adrift is the hardboiled origin story to Kusler's popular Las Vegas Mystery series.\n\nUnabridged.\nRead by Patrick Lawlor.\n\n-------------------------------\nMore audiobooks:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&lt;/a&gt;\n-------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91c0c0dfbe79bb7d3fd148e727abe5ab5de2cff2","amp;dn":"Snow+Adrift+-+Rex+Kusler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91c0c0dfbe79bb7d3fd148e727abe5ab5de2cff2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,192,192,223,190,121,187,125,63,209,72,231,39,171,229,171,93,226,207,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
