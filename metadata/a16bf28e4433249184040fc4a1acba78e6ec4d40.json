This single issue of The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show features a crossover from no less than The Amazing Spider-Man himself. A hilarious issue with some nice easter eggs and callbacks to classic Spidey stories. Also, this issue was written by Dan Slott! Yes, the man currently responsible for the Superior Spider-Man and many other great Spidey stories penned this joke tale. All credit to the original scanners, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a16bf28e4433249184040fc4a1acba78e6ec4d40","amp;dn":"Ren+%26amp%3B+Stimpy+Show+06+-+Spider-Man+vs.+Powdered+Toast+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a16bf28e4433249184040fc4a1acba78e6ec4d40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,107,242,142,68,51,36,145,132,4,15,196,161,172,186,120,230,236,77,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
