It was directed by Gene Kelly. It features a large number of cameos, including Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Terry-Thomas, Jayne Mansfield, Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, Joey Bishop, and Wally Cox. The title song, performed by The Turtles, was composed by John Williams with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse.\n\nPlot\n\nPaul Manning discovers one day that his dear friend and neighbor Ed Stander has been cheating on his wife. Curious, he asks Ed about it and is given the history and tactics of men who have successfully committed adultery. With each new story, Paul can't help but notice the attractive blonde, Irma Johnson, who lives nearby.\n\nPaul gets close to cheating on his wife Ruth, but he never quite goes through with it. In a scene near the end when he is in a motel room with another woman, he hears sirens approaching. He panics and waits for the police, only to find them going to the room next door where his friend Ed is in bed with Mrs. Johnson. Paul takes this opportunity to flee the scene and run home to his beloved wife.\n\nCast\n\n    * Walter Matthau ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Paul Manning\n    * Inger Stevens ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ruth Manning\n    * Sue Ane Langdon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Irma Johnson\n    * Jackie Russell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Miss Harris, Manning's Secretary\n    * Robert Morse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ed Stander\n    * Aline Towne ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mousey Man's Wife\n    * Claire Kelly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Harriet Stander\n    * Eve Brent ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Joe X's Blowsy Blonde\n    * Marvin Brody ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Taxi Driver\n    * Majel Barrett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mrs. Fred V.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3d1ee25277cc009e2b6de6435104d555098cecc","amp;dn":"A+Guide+For+The+Married+Man+%28Comedy+-+Matthau%2C+Morse%2C+Lucille+Ba","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3d1ee25277cc009e2b6de6435104d555098cecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,209,238,37,39,124,192,9,226,182,222,100,53,16,77,85,80,152,206,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
