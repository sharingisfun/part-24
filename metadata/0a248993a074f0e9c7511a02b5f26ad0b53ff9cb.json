Shine a Light\n3. Cheapster\n4. Electricity\n5. Soul On Fire\n6. Sweet Talk\n7. Sitting On Fire\n8. Walking With Jesus\n9. Oh Baby\n10. Rated X\n11. Lay Back In the Sun\n12. Death Take Your Fiddle\n13. She Kissed Me (It Felt Like a Hit)\n14. Come Together\n15. Take Me To The Other Side\n16. Interview with J.
