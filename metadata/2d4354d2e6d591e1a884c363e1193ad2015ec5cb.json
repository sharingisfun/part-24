Osbourne rose to prominence as lead vocalist of pioneering English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, and eventually achieved a multi-platinum solo career which revolutionized the heavy metal genre. As a result he is known as the &quot;Godfather of Heavy Metal&quot;, and, because of some of his material, the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;. In the early 2000s, his career as a celebrity hit a new zenith when he became a star in his own reality show, The Osbournes alongside wife/manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack. In August 2008, Osbourne stated in USA Today that he intends to retire from his music career after two more albums.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d4354d2e6d591e1a884c363e1193ad2015ec5cb","amp;dn":"Ozzy+Osbourne+-+Breaking+All+The+Rules","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d4354d2e6d591e1a884c363e1193ad2015ec5cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,67,84,210,230,213,145,225,168,132,195,99,225,25,58,210,1,94,197,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
