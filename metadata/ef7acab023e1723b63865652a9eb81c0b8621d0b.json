Centered on guitarist, keyboardist, songwriter, and producer Tom Scholz, the band is a staple of classic rock radio playlists. Boston's best-known works include the songs &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;, &quot;Foreplay/Long Time&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Band&quot;, &quot;Smokin'&quot;, &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; and &quot;Amanda.&quot; They have sold over 31 million albums in the United States, of which 17 million are their self-titled debut album and 7 million are their second album, Don't Look Back.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBarry Goudreau (November 29, 1951) is a musician, best known as one of the original guitarists for the rock band Boston.\n\nBarry Goudreau is the debut self-titled album of original Boston guitar front man, Barry Goudreau. With the use of Boston members Brad Delp (vocals), and Sib Hashian (drums), and future Boston singer Fran Cosmo the album displays a sound very similar to that of Boston's first two releases Boston (1976) and Don't Look Back (1978). However, neither this album, nor any of Goudreau's subsequent releases with other acts ( Orion The Hunter, RTZ) proved to be as large of a commercial success as his work with Boston. The album was released in 1980 and was Goudreau's only solo album. The song &quot;Dreams&quot; was released as a single in 1980 nearly cracking Billboard's top 100 and still receives air play today on Classic rock radio stations along with &quot;Mean Woman Blues&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef7acab023e1723b63865652a9eb81c0b8621d0b","amp;dn":"Boston+-+Mission+Aborted+%5B1975-76%5D%5B1980%5D%5B1996%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef7acab023e1723b63865652a9eb81c0b8621d0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,122,202,176,35,225,114,59,99,134,86,82,169,235,129,192,184,98,29,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
