Welcome Back, Mr. McDonald\n\n\n--Movie info--\nGenre.........: Comedy / Drama\nYear..........: 1997\nCountry.......: Japan\nRuntime.......: 103 min\nDirector......: Koki Mitani (ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚Â¸Ã¢â‚¬Â°ÃƒÂ¨Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â·ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¹Ã‚Â¸ÃƒÂ¥Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ…â€œ)\nIMDB..........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133170/\nIMDB rating...: 7.8/10\n\n\n--Release info--\nSource...........: R2J DVD9 (NTSC)\nResolution.......: 720x480\nAspect ratio.....: anamorphic widescreen (1.8125)\nVideo codec......: H.264 (High Profile, Level 3.1)\nVideo bitrate....: 1557 Kb/s\nAudio............: Japanese 2.0 (Dolby Pro Logic II)\nAudio codec......: AAC-LC (VBR)\nAudio bitrate....: 198 Kb/s\nSubtitles........: English (ASS and SRT softsubs)\n\n\n--Comment--\nI couldn't find a working torrent of this forgotten gem anywhere except the DVD ISO itself, so I decided to re-encode it for wider distribution (at the original resolution with generous bitrate). I don't know if it'll play back on H.264-capable standalones (PS3, Xbox360, etc.) - please leave a comment if you try it.\n\nIf you can't view this for some reason, I recommend the Combined Community Codec Pack ( http://www.cccp-project.net/ ).\n\n\n--New York Times review--\nComedy is certainly not the first thing that comes to mind when we think of Japanese cinema. But a few more films like Koki Mitani's hilarious screwball farce &quot;Welcome Back, Mr. McDonald&quot; could change all that.\n\nThis movie is ostensibly a goofy comedy about a live radio drama that goes haywire after the imperious diva playing the lead insists on certain last-minute changes. Her demands set in motion a desperate chain of events that transform a sudsy romantic drama set in a Japanese fishing village into a ludicrous action-adventure fantasy set in the United States.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d5f4b77db4c0dbdc2aaea61d116670fff45b8a2","amp;dn":"Rajio+no+Jikan+%28Welcome+Back%2C+Mr.+McDonald%29+%281997%29+%5Bx264%5D+-+coj","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d5f4b77db4c0dbdc2aaea61d116670fff45b8a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,95,75,119,219,76,13,189,194,170,234,97,209,22,103,15,255,69,184,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
