Obviously pissed off. And perhaps just pissed too? ;-) Intoxication is Evil itself, he said in a recent Vrij Nederland interview. &quot;I'm a complete asshole when I'm drunk, and every gulp is a step in that direction. So I'm in conflict with myself right now.&quot; And with the audience too.\n\nDuring Straw Foot (Not gonna join you in your tower of babble, boy/Tired of that talk/Sick of that noise!) he turned his mikestand round to face the babbling audience. Was this some sort of rock star gesture? (&quot;scream for me, Tilburg&quot;, that sort of thing) or an ironic comment? Most of the audience went for option number one. And yelled and cheered. Right reaction? Wrong reaction? David didn't seem te bo pleased. Somewhat puzzingly he said he wasn't here to impress us. And he threw the mikestand to the floor. Fortunately there's always what used to be called a roadie, though we now have to refer to them as technicians (stewardess -&gt; flight attendant) to pick it up.\n\nAnd fortunately 16hp played a good set. Yeah, you know the one ;-&gt; It was good but there was just that little bit extra missing (I know, this sounds very blasÃƒÂ© ) to make it extraordinary. Something in the interaction between band and audience. So if marks are to be given, I'd say 8 out of 10. And not 10 out of 10, like Paris the night before, as everyone said. Why is always the gig you don't go to that special? ;-).\n\nDespite talking all the time the crowd was very impressed by the show judged by the applause when the band left the stage for the first time. Something 'funny' happened then. David was the last one on stage. Doing his virtual handshakes and even throwing in the occasional blessing that would not look out of place during the Urbi et Orbi from the Vatican. He made a sort of throwaway gesture favoured by soccer players when they don't agree with a referee's decision (that wasn't offside!) towards where the rest of the band had exited 013's huge stage. As if he wanted to bask in the applause, the glory all by himself. As if he wanted to take all of the credits. During the heydays of The Pixies, Black Francis appeared on the cover of a music magazine stating &quot;I AM The Pixies&quot;. This seemed to insinuate the same. Well, perhaps they'll do a cover of Gigantic now (Ace Of Spades seems to be out of the question ;-)\n\nThis was 16hp's biggest show in The Netherlands (and thus the world? ;-) so far as a headliner, not counting festivals. 013 has a capacity of 2.200 people. And though it wasn't sold out, it was very well filled. Quite a change from playing in front of 400 or less people like on some other dates on this leg of the tour. Perhaps they wanted to proof themselves for such a big crowd. And because things didn't go quite as they had hoped their was an itsybitsyteenieweenie sense of disappointment. There's no need for that though. They are only getting better and better. The set is even more fluent now. Wayfaring Stranger (with additonal lyrics) now has an extended extro and seamlessly becomes Harm's Way. Which in turn naturally turns into American Wheeze. The Clogger solo sounded slightly different and great and Steve's backing vocals could be heard this time. Elin is doing backing vocals too. And the Gallic rhythm-section forms a strong and reliable backbone. It was a concert well worth talking about (but not during ;-).\n\nBy Martin \n\nSetlist:\nSilver Saddle\nPraying Arm Lane\nSplinters\nWayfaring Stranger\nHarm's Way\nAmerican Wheeze\nBurning Bush\nPoor Mouth\nStraw Foot (Mikestand incident)\nClogger\n======\nStrong Man\nFlowers in my Heart\nCinder Alley\nLow Estate\nBlack Soul Choir\n======\nFor Heaven's Sake","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba5c4fa448a505056d33ff383ac383affe39a0c","amp;dn":"16+Horsepower+-+Mikestand+Incident+%28013+Tilburg+31-5-2000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba5c4fa448a505056d33ff383ac383affe39a0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,165,196,250,68,138,80,80,86,211,63,243,131,172,56,58,255,227,154,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
