After growing up in numerous locations with his military family, Denver began his music career in folk music groups in the late 1960s. His greatest commercial success was as a solo singer. Throughout his life Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he composed. He performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature, his enthusiasm for music, and relationship trials.\nDenver further starred in films and several notable television specials in the 1970s and 1980s. In the following decades he continued to record, but also focused on calling attention to environmental issues, lent his vocal support to space exploration, and testified in front of Congress to protest censorship in music. He is known for his love of the state of Colorado, which he sang about numerous times. He lived in Aspen, Colorado for much of his life. The Colorado state legislature also adopted &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; as one of its state songs in 2007. He was an avid pilot, and died while flying his personal aircraft at the age of 53. Denver was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the 1970s.\n[From Wikipedia]\n\n- LINKS\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.johndenver.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.johndenver.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscography: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Denver_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Denver_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n- AVAILABLE DISCOGRAPHY FOR THIS COMPILATION:\n1969_Rhymes &amp; Reasons\n1970_Take Me To Tomorrow\n1970_Whose Garden Was This\n1971_Aerie\n1971_Poems, Prayers &amp; Promises\n1972_Rocky Mountain High\n1973_Farewell Andromeda\n1974_Back Home Again\n1975_An Evening With John Denver\n1975_Windsong\n1976_Spirit\n1977_I Want To Live\n1978_Live At The Sydney Opera House\n1979_ John Denver\n1980_Autograph\n1981_Some Days Are Diamonds\n1982_Seasons Of The Heart\n1983_It's About Time\n1985_Dreamland Express\n1986_One World\n1989_Higher Ground\n1990_The Flower That Shattered The Stone\n1995_The Harbor Lights Concert\n1996_The Unplugged Collection\n1997_Live\n2004_Definitive All-Time Greatest Hits\n\n- COVER IMAGES\nThe original cover art (for the single/LP or CD) is included in the Info Tag of the mp3 file\n\n- LYRICS\nLyrics are included in the torrent (PDF file)\n\n-ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nMany Thanks to all the beautiful web sites from which I &quot;leeched&quot; all the information, images and lyrics.
