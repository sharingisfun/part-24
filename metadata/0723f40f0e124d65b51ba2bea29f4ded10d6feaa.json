Written and Presented by Dr Geoff Bunn, with Paul Bhattacharjee, Jonathan Forbes and Hattie Morahan.\n\nA History of the Brain is a journey through 5000 years of our understanding of the most complex thing in the known universe. From Neolithic times to the present day, Geoff journeys through the many ideas of what the brain is for and how it fulfils its functions. While referencing the core physiology and neuroscience, this is a cultural, not a scientific history. What soon becomes obvious is that our understanding of this most inscrutable organ has in all periods been coloured by the social and political expedients of the day no less than by the contemporary scope of scientific or biological exploration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0723f40f0e124d65b51ba2bea29f4ded10d6feaa","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+Brain+%28BBC+Radio+4+Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0723f40f0e124d65b51ba2bea29f4ded10d6feaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,35,244,15,14,18,77,101,181,27,162,190,162,159,77,237,16,214,254,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
