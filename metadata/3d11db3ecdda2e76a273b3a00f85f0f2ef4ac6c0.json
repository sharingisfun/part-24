But then, African Head Charge (a band with a constantly changing membership led by percussionist Bonjo Iyabinghi Noah) doesn't really make typical reggae albums. \r\nAlthough the one-drop beat (provided on this album by Lincoln &quot;Style&quot; Scott) influences everything and the basslines have a typical tidal undertow, the stuff that Noah layers on top of the mix has more to do with ethnomusicology than the dancehall. The song titles say it all: &quot;Cattle Herders Chant,&quot; a field recording of call-and-response chanting overlaid with Nyahbinghi drums and highlife guitar; &quot;My God,&quot; eerie, minor-key African-American church singing supported by a chugging reggae bassline, bare-bones drumming, and the sound of running water; &quot;Deer Spirit Song,&quot; an unidentifiable indigenous song in 9/8 meter with a gently driving rockers beat and occasional sound effects thrown in. \r\nThis is an exceptionally beautiful album, but in a deeply strange way.
