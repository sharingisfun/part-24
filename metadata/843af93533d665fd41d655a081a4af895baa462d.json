The people of Aquilonia, who originally welcomed Conan as their liberator from Numedides' tyranny, have gradually turned against him due to his foreign Cimmerian blood. They have built a statue to Numedides' memory in the temple of Mitra, and people burn incense before it, hailing it as the holy effigy of a saintly monarch who was done to death by a red-handed barbarian.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:843af93533d665fd41d655a081a4af895baa462d","amp;dn":"The+Phoenix+on+the+Sword+Conan+the+Barbarian+1+by+Robert+Ervin+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"843af93533d665fd41d655a081a4af895baa462d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,58,249,53,51,214,101,253,65,214,85,160,129,164,175,137,91,170,70,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
