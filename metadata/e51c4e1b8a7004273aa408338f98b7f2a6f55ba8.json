Ongoing workshops each day of the Congress.\n\nLearn to hack with microcontrollers! Starting with an inexpensive kit (MiniPOV, by Limor Fried, aka Ladyada), this hands-on workshop will teach you to do almost anything with microcontrollers. Throughout the days of the Congress, Mitch, the inventor of TV-B-Gone, will be giving ongoing workshops on hacking with microcontrollers. Learn to make cool devices! Projects that you can build include:\n\n    * Make your own trippy colored-light-blinking thingy\n    * Make your own device to meditate and hallucinate with brainwaves (as seen in MAKE Magazine issue #10)\n    * Make your own simplified TV-B-Gone\n    * Make your own bug robot that sings and dances\n    * Light up and sequence EL-wire\n    * Learn how to solder\n    * Learn how to program with firmware\n    * Learn how to use microcontroller development tools on your laptop\n    * Tips, tricks, and more... All the parts you need, handouts, plus all tools will be available at the workbench at the Congress.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e51c4e1b8a7004273aa408338f98b7f2a6f55ba8","amp;dn":"24c3-2214-en-make_cool_things_with_microcontrollers.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e51c4e1b8a7004273aa408338f98b7f2a6f55ba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,28,78,27,138,112,4,39,58,164,8,51,143,152,183,242,166,245,91,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
