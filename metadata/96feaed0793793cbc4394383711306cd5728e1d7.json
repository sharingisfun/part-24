These technologies must be simple, less expensive, less energy intensive, and easy to maintain for their adaptation among the poor masses.\nFour appropriate technologies are discussed here: solar pasteurization, membrane desalination, natural filtration (riverbank filtration), and solar distillation. Solar pasteurization can be a useful means of producing water at remote, but sunny locations where fuel may not be easily available for boiling water. Membrane desalination will remain as a viable means of drinking water production for individual households to large communities. Various membrane filtration techniques as well as the means to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdemocratizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ membrane filtration have been presented. Riverbank filtration is a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnaturalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ filtration technique where drinking water is produced by placing wells on the banks of rivers. The riverbed/bank material and the underlying aquifer act as natural filters to remove pollutants from river water. Solar distillation can be a viable method of drinking water production for individual households to small communities without the input of external energy. Sustainability framework and technology transfer are discussed through transdisciplinary analysis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96feaed0793793cbc4394383711306cd5728e1d7","amp;dn":"Drinking+Water+Treatment+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96feaed0793793cbc4394383711306cd5728e1d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,254,174,208,121,55,147,203,196,57,67,131,113,19,6,205,87,40,225,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
