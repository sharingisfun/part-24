When psychiatrist Andi Manette\nand her two young daughters are kidnapped, Lucas must discover whether it's a \nransom snatch, the work of oneof Andi's ex-patients or the ruse of someone in her\nlife who might benefit from her death. (Her father, stepmother, estranged husband \nand medical partner are all good suspects.) Readers know the kidnapper is John\nMail, a scary ex-patient who's entertained nasty dreams of Andi for years. He\nenacts his violent sex fantasies with the imprisoned Andi; it seems only a matter\nof time before he will go after the girls. Lucas, meanwhile, draws on all\navailable resources, including his own computer game company, to flush out Mail,\na gamer who enjoys taunting Lucas with phone calls. During this time, Andi has\nbeen trying to maintain an element of control and contrive an escape. Sandford\nexpertly ratchets up the suspense from beginning to the brutal finish. Lucas does\nget his villain, but no one comes out of this experience unscarred.\n                                          **Publishers Weekly\n********************************************************************************\n\nEnjoy it!
