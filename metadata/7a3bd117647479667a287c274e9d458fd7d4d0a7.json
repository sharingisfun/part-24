There's a lot of Gospel (and some Southern Gospel) including All Sons And Daughters, The Collingsworth Family, Crist Family, Donald Lawrence, Laura Story, and Mountain Faith.  There's even a Bluegrass album from The Bankesters that you might want to check out.  If Alternative music is your interest, then be sure to get a copy of Dustin Kensrue, Josiah James, and Thomas Dybdahl.  Folk music?  How about Guthrie.  Are you looking for some Praise &amp; Worship today?  How about Hillsong, Jake Cantrell, Kate Hurley, and Women Of Faith.  Jacob Wright might be considered Rock.  And John Tibbs might be considered Indie.  After several Christmas albums in my last 41st bundle, there are only two in this 42nd bundle.  You can choose from either Jonathan Butler, and Paul Baloche.  And there are three Pop albums available including Martin Smith, Natalie Grant, and Press Play.  If you're looking for Singer-Songwriter then consider Nick Law, and Steve Grand.  There's a great upbeat Acapella album from Vive.  And rounding it all out once again, if you're a Metal fan, you're going to want to get the newest Wolves At The Gate.\n\nBundle 42 includes the following 33 releases, bringing out total shared for the year up to 1,173 titles...\n\n * 7vnseal - 2013 - Stop The Invasion\n * All Sons And Daughters - 2013 - A Night Of Worship Tour Sampler\n * Ambassador, The - 2013 - Hors D' Oeuvres EP\n * Bankesters, The - 2013 - Looking Forward\n * Collingsworth Family, The - 2013 - Hymns From Home\n * Crist Family - 2013 - Because Of Love\n * Donald Lawrence - 2013 - Best For Last - 20 Year Celebration, Vol 1\n * Dustin Kensrue - 2013 - The Water And The Blood\n * Flame - 2013 - Royal Flush\n * Guthrie - 2013 - Softer Ground\n * Hillsong - 2013 - We Are Young And Free\n * Jacob Wright - 2013 - The Flame - Single\n * Jake Cantrell - 2013 - Surrender All EP\n * John Tibbs - 2013 - Anchor EP\n * Jonathan Butler - 2013 - Merry Christmas To You\n * Josiah James - 2013 - Sinking Ships - Single\n * Kate Hurley - 2013 - I Will Be With You - Single\n * Laura Story - 2013 - God Of Every Story\n * Martin Smith - 2013 - Gods Great Dance Floor - Step 2\n * Mountain Faith - 2013 - Battlefield\n * Natalie Grant - 2013 - For All Of Us - Single\n * Nick Law - 2013 - The Lord Is My Shephred - Single\n * Paul Baloche - 2013 - Christmas Worship\n * Press Play - 2013 - Lito\n * Steve Grand - 2013 - Stay - Single\n * Thomas Dybdahl - 2013 - What's Left Is Forever - Deluxe\n * Trilogy - 2013 - They Can't Stop Me - Single\n * Trilogy - 2013 - Toxic\n * Trilogy - 2013 - Toxic - Single\n * Various - 2013 - Christian ElectroMixx, Vol 7\n * Vive - 2013 - Vive EP\n * Wolves At The Gate - 2013 - Back To School EP\n * Women Of Faith - 2013 - Gateway Worship Collection\n\nBe Blessed,\nTorrentTracts - October 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a3bd117647479667a287c274e9d458fd7d4d0a7","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+42%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a3bd117647479667a287c274e9d458fd7d4d0a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,59,209,23,100,116,121,102,122,40,124,39,78,157,69,143,215,212,208,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
