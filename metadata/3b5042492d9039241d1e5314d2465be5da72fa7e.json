What was once a passionate union becomes spite, greed, backstabbing, and betrayal. 'Fatal Vows explores tumultuous, shocking, and high-stake divorces and the deadly murders linked to them. Guiding viewers through these passionate accounts of love gone wrong are Dr. Stacy Kaiser, a psychotherapist and relationship expert, and Dr. Brian Russell, a forensic psychologist and attorney. From husbands, wives, children, grandparents, mistresses and friends, divorce can lead even the most unthinkable people to commit murder.
