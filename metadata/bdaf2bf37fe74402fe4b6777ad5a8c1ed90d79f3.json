Soon after settling in, the family is trapped in the hotel by a snowstorm,\nand Jack gradually becomes influenced by a supernatural presence; he descends into madness and attempts to murder his wife and son.\nUnlike previous Kubrick films, which developed an audience gradually by building on word-of-mouth\nThe Shining was released as a mass-market film, opening at first in just two cities on Memorial Day, \nthen nationwide a month later.\nAlthough initial response to the film was mixed, later critical assessment was more favorable and it is now listed among the greatest horror movies\nwhile some have even viewed it as one of the greatest films of all time. Film director Martin Scorsese,\nwriting in The Daily Beast, ranked it as one of the 11 scariest horror movies of all time\nFilm critics, film students, and Kubrick's producer Jan Harlan, have remarked on the enormous influence the film has had on popular culture\nThe initial European release of The Shining was 25 minutes shorter than the American version, \nachieved by removing most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel.\n===================================================================\nThe Shining (1980) Movie\nRatings: 8,5/10 from 435.324 users  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/&lt;/a&gt;\nGenre: Horror\nRelease date(s): May 23, (1980)\nDirected by: Stanley Kubrick\nLanguage: English\nBased on: The Shining by Stephen King\nMusic by: Wendy Carlos,Rachel Elkind\nStarring: Jack Nicholson,Shelley Duvall,Danny Lloyd,Scatman Crothers.\nBox office: $44,360,123\n===================================================================\nVideo Specifications:\nFormat___________________________________: Matroska\nFile size________________________________: 4.32 GiB\nDuration_________________________________: 2h 23mn\nOverall bit rate_________________________: 4 300 Kbps\nFormat___________________________________: AVC\nFormat/Info______________________________: Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile___________________________: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;357d5c525d7579011b04&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nBit rate_________________________________: 3 660 Kbps\nWidth____________________________________: 1 920 pixels\nHeight___________________________________: 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio_____________________: 16:9\nFrame rate_______________________________: 23.976 fps\n.__________________________________________________________________.\nAudio Specifications:\nFormat___________________________________: AC-3\nDuration_________________________________: 2h 23mn\nBit rate mode____________________________: Constant\nBit rate_________________________________: 640 Kbps\nChannel(s)_______________________________: 6 channels\nChannel positions________________________: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate____________________________: 48.0 KHz\nBit depth________________________________: 16 bits\n===================================================================\n&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\nFeel free to give your Vote up and a comment,if you Deslike or Have Suggestions to improve Something Don't get Angry!&quot;Just leave a comment so we can work On it.\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy!
