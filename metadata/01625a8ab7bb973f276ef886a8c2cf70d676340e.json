Topics of the book include: Space is Full!, Crop Circles, Ancient Civilizations, Unified Field Theory and Cosmological Observations. \n\nIt is truly amazing to learn of Nassim's current theories and compare them with his original pieces of work from many years ago. It is no wonder he calls his organization The Resonance Project. \n\nFor more information and to get involved with this project please consider visiting theresonanceproject.org or view more of Nassim's videos that are available on various streaming websites.
