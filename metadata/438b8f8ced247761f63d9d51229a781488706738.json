During the War, the number of Australian POWs on the island had dropped from 1100 to less than 300 due to abuses by their Japanese captors. Capt. Cooper is the chief prosecutor. In a mass grave, the bodies of 300 executed servicemen have been unearthed. Cooper assumes that the massacre was ordered by Baron Takahashi, Japanese commander on Ambon. But the one potential witness has gone mad and is due to be shipped back to Australia. No captured airmen were found alive on the island at all, not even the four-man crew of a reconnaissance plane shot down late in the War. Takahashi is returned to the island in the custody of an American officer, Maj. Beckett. But there is little evidence with which to prosecute the Baron.\n\nSize:0.99 GB\n720 x 406\nTime 1:49:57\nFPS: 25\n\t\t\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Oath_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Oath_(film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nUploaded again; Let's see if it works now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:438b8f8ced247761f63d9d51229a781488706738","amp;dn":"Prisoners+of+the+Sun+1990","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"438b8f8ced247761f63d9d51229a781488706738","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,139,143,140,237,36,119,97,246,61,157,81,34,154,120,20,136,112,103,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
