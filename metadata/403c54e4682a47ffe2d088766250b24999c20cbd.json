FLAC\n\nBodycall emerged on the Dark Independent scene only recently, however the band is not a newcomer, as they have been active since 2002. Their style evolved from oldshool ebm and synthopop sounds to crystalize as modern and quite aggresive dark electro / aggrotech. Fast, danceable &quot;trancy&quot; songs with screaming raw vocals are trademark of this band and this is what you can expect from &quot;Mechanically Recovered Meat&quot;.\n\nTracklist:\n01. Beyond Control (2009 Comatose Mix)\n02. Disciples of Hedone (Club Mix)\n03. You and Me (Recovery Mix)\n04. Fools' Paradise (Too Disco Mix)\n05.
