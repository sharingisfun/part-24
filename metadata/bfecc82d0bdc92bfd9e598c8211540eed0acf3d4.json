The example he set of statesmanship, courage, prudence, and\nmagnanimity shines like a beacon down the years, to be looked to\nwherever the American experiment in ordered liberty and\nself-government is honored.\n\nNow, with this course devoted to Abraham Lincoln: In His Own Words,\nyou can trace the sources and development of Lincoln's rhetorical\ngreatness with the help of one of America's leading teachers of speech\nand public communication.\n\nProfessor David Zarefsky brings scholarly rigor and passion to bear in\na way that you'll find most rewarding. You'll witness American history\nin the making as you follow Lincoln's career as an orator from the\nYoung Men's Lyceum Speech of 1838 to the majestic biblical cadences of\nthe Second Inaugural. You'll even learn about the last speech Lincoln\never gave--a talk on his plans for Reconstruction, delivered at the\nWhite House just three days before his death.\n\n               \nPart I \nLecture 1: Lincoln and Rhetoric\nLecture 2: The Lyceum Speech, 1838\nLecture 3: The Temperance Speech, 1842\nLecture 4: Lincoln as a Young Whig\nLecture 5: Lincoln Returns to Politics\nLecture 6: The Peoria Speech, 1854\nLecture 7: Lincoln's Rhetoric and Politics, 1854-1857\nLecture 8: The Springfield Speech, 1857\nLecture 9: The &quot;House Divided&quot; Speech, 1858\nLecture 10: The Chicago Speech, July 1858\nLecture 11: The Springfield Speech, July 1858\nLecture 12: The Debate About the Debates\n\nPart II\nLecture 13: The Lincoln-Douglas Debates I\nLecture 14: The Lincoln-Douglas Debates II\nLecture 15: The Lincoln-Douglas Debates III\nLecture 16: The Aftermath of the Debates\nLecture 17: Lincoln's 1859 Speeches\nLecture 18: The Cooper Union Speech, 1860\nLecture 19: The Campaign of 1860\nLecture 20: The First Inaugural Address\nLecture 21: Justifying the War\nLecture 22: Moving Toward Emancipation\nLecture 23: Lincoln at Gettysburg\nLecture 24: Lincoln's Last Speeches\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfecc82d0bdc92bfd9e598c8211540eed0acf3d4","amp;dn":"Abraham+Lincoln-+In+His+Own+Words","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfecc82d0bdc92bfd9e598c8211540eed0acf3d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,236,200,45,11,220,146,191,217,229,152,200,33,21,64,238,208,172,243,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
