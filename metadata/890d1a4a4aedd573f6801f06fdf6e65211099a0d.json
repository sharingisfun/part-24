Overreaction of the community in times of stress particularly, when\nscapegoats for unexplained phenomena are sought, might have played an important\nrole in this and many subsequent incidents of suspected poisoning. Rome\nrepresented a culture steeped in superstition, fear and mythology with virtually no\nscientific means of retrospectively proving or disproving alleged poisoning. The\ndrug trade in antiquity is briefly reviewed, from the Marsi and rootcutters who\ncollected materials, and the intermediary herbalists and drug pedlars, to the\nphysicians and other prescribers of drugs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:890d1a4a4aedd573f6801f06fdf6e65211099a0d","amp;dn":"POISONS+IN+ANCIENT+ROME","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"890d1a4a4aedd573f6801f06fdf6e65211099a0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,13,26,74,74,237,213,115,246,128,31,6,253,246,230,82,17,9,154,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
