I have over 300 movies converted to AVC H.264 480x272 128kbps/48kHz format. To play these movies, I have a couple words of advice:\n\n1.) Upgrade your firmware\n2.) Get a MS Pro Duo that&amp;#039;s at least 8GB. (They&amp;#039;re going down in price nowadays) I&amp;#039;m saving up for the 32GB ones in 2009.\n3.) DON&amp;#039;T BUY YOUR MS PRO DUOS OFF EBAY. YOU WILL GET RIPPED. See this article for details: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://reviews.ebay.com/FAKE-Sony-Memory-Stick-Pro-Duo-MagicGate-Cards-Exposed_W0QQugidZ10000000001236041&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://reviews.ebay.com/FAKE-Sony-Memory-Stick-Pro-Duo-MagicGate-Cards-Exposed_W0QQugidZ10000000001236041&lt;/a&gt;\n4.) Drop the .mp4 &amp; icon file in X:Video folder, whereas &quot;X:&quot; represents your PSP showing up as a USB Mass-Storage Drive\n5.) Download PEERGUARDIAN &amp; run it. Do a google search for it. It&amp;#039;s FREE.\n6.) When you download a torrent, such as &quot;Family Guy Complete Series on PSP 114 Episodes&quot;, if using a client such as Azureus, you don&amp;#039;t need to download the entire set of 228 files. If just the last 5 episodes are what you want to watch, then only check the last 5 episodes before confirming your download. -duh!\n7.) Last but certainly not least, this took me a lot of work. Your positive comments are always appreciated. I would like to give my thanks out to the team @ PSPVideo9, and the team @ http://www.logmein.com\n\nMy public URL:\thttp://thepiratebay.se/user/joe.uploader\nMy RSS feed:\thttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/a377ff1b31f46ea06c2d299df7bde1d9\n\nI am currently running The Complete Series of Family Guy (114 Episodes, current until 16NOV08&amp;#039;S &quot;Tales of a Third Grade Nothing&quot;), Back To The Future, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Jurassic Park. While I don&amp;#039;t have the last Indiana Jones film, &quot;Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull&quot;, I don&amp;#039;t plan on getting it &amp;#039;cause it sucked. Other than that, please post comments &amp; give ratings. Make requests for more files, if you please; and maybe next year (JAN09) I will get a rotation going. I also have PSP .isos and plenty of emulators for PSP slim. I don&amp;#039;t know anything about hacking a PSP Phat, but I can post some nice Homebrew, Emulators, and ISOs, as well as PSX eBoots for a couple Final Fantasy games next month, if you guys indicate via comments that you are interested, just to give you an idea. Please don&amp;#039;t flame &amp;/or post racial/sterotypical/sexual/immature comments, they will be ignored, and they make you look like a fool. Arguing on the internet is like competing in the special olympics: Even if you win, you&amp;#039;re still retarded.\n*********************END BLANKET STATEMENT FOR NOV2008**************************\n\n***FAMILY GUY Complete Series on PSP 114 Episodes***\nEpisode Guide Here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.epguides.com/FamilyGuy/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.epguides.com/FamilyGuy/&lt;/a&gt;\nRipped from DVDs, Amazon.com, and of course, converted from other PirateBay files.\n\nMy personal favorites are Episodes 10, 108, and 114.\n****************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ab59aa8d0520f80f6c21d5ba4fab6cf64b17033","amp;dn":"FAMILY+GUY+Complete+Series+on+PSP+114+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ab59aa8d0520f80f6c21d5ba4fab6cf64b17033","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,181,154,168,208,82,15,128,246,194,29,91,164,250,182,207,100,177,112,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
