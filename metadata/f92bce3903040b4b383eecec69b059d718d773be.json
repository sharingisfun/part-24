As of January 2007, it has yet to be reissued on CD, unlike \nNuclear Assault&amp;#039;s other albums. It is very rare and &quot;Out Of Print&quot; making it a \ncollectors item. Fetching a handsome sum for private sellers.\n\nReleased June 13, 1988 \nRecorded Jan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Feb, 1988\nThe Music Grinder,\nLos Angeles, California, USA \nGenre Thrash metal\nCrossover Thrash \nLength 30:15 \nLabel Relativity Records\nUnder One Flag\nI.R.S. Records \nProducer Randy Burns \n\n\nBiography\nNuclear Assault were among thrash metal&amp;#039;s most socially aware groups, \nmaking room for serious subject matter (and occasional goofs) in their \ncareening speed metal riffing. They also remained closer to the world of \nhardcore than most of their peers, and at their late-&amp;#039;80s peak released some \nof the most uncompromising thrash metal offerings of the time. After \nperforming on Anthrax&amp;#039; 1984 debut Fistful of Metal, bass player Danny Lilker \ndecided to jump ship and search for a more aggressive outlet for his music. \nLilker formed Nuclear Assault with vocalist and guitarist John Connelly (also \nbriefly a member of Anthrax in its formative years) in 1985. Guitarist Mike \nBogush and drummer Scott Duboys only lasted a few months before being \nreplaced by guitarist Anthony Bramante and ex-T.T. Quick powerhouse \ndrummer Glenn Evans. One of the Big Apple&amp;#039;s few challengers (along with \nAnthrax and Overkill) to the Bay Area dominance of all things thrash metal, \nNuclear Assault became immediate contenders due to the cumulative sum of \nits parts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ not to mention, their extreme nature and their ability to back it up \nwith solid musicianship. Produced by metal stalwart Alex Perialas, their first \nalbum, 1986&amp;#039;s Game Over, was regarded as a breath of fresh air with its \npotent speed metal tinged with hardcore overtones. In the process, fans and \ncritics alike instantly accepted it and the band was quickly off to the races. \n\nThe following year The Plague E.P. was an even more intense aural \nexperience, but also managed to introduce Nuclear Assault&amp;#039;s dark sense of \nhumor with an ode to MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e singer Vince Neil (fresh off his vehicular \nmanslaughter rap) on &quot;Butt Fuck&quot; (later retitled &quot;You Figure It Out&quot;). With \nconstant touring making up for their obvious commercial limitations, the band \ncontinued to hone their craft in the studio, beginning with 1988&amp;#039;s greatly \nimproved Survive and culminating in 1989 the outstanding Handle With Care. \nThe latter proved that the group could refine their political speed metal and \nsongwriting without compromising their anti-establishment stance, and was \nsupported by successful Euro tours with thrash titans Exodus, and later U.S. \njaunts with Testament and Savatage. 1990s Live\nat Hammersmith Odeon video celebrated this great phase, and the band \ncame off the road having won a healthy dose of new believers. Shortly \nafterwards the band released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOut Of OrderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and in 1992 Dan Lilker left to \npursue Brutal Truth. The band released one more album (Something Wicked) \nand broke up. \n\nIn early 2002 the band was approached by a mutual friend to reform for a \ncouple of shows. Their first reunion show was a the Metal Meltdown in April \nand there they found out that their was a demand for the band to continue. \nThey played the classic NYC venue CBGB in May along with a show in \nMassachusetts that was recorded for a live album to be released on \nScreaming Ferret Wreckords in early 2003. After a triumphant performance \nat the infamous Wacken Open Air festival in Germany in August, original \nguitarist Anthony Bramante left the band due to commitments at home and \nwas replaced by Erik Burke. In September 2002 the band returned to Sao \nPaolo, Brazil, where they had played back in 1989 with the then fledging \nSepultura opening. \n\nNuclear Assault is currently in the process of writing music for the first new \nstudio album in 10 years, and will be appearing at festivals thru Europe in \n2003 and in the US on a mini tour thru the Southwest and West Coast in late \nJanuary and early February.\n\nOfficial Home Page: h**p://www.nuclearassault.us/\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f92bce3903040b4b383eecec69b059d718d773be","amp;dn":"Nuclear+Assault+-+Survive+%5B1988%5D%5BFLAC%5D-%5BWH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f92bce3903040b4b383eecec69b059d718d773be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,43,206,57,3,4,11,75,56,62,236,236,105,176,89,215,24,215,115,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
