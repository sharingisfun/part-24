Originally formed in 1997, the group released a pair of demos in 1999 and 2000 before signing a contract with Englands Candlelight Records, and making their full-length debut via 2002s In the Halls of Awaiting CD. Two additional albums - Since the Day It All Came Down, Above the Weeping World and Across the Dark - have since followed, in 2004, 2006 and 2009 respectively, and not only confirmed Insomniums enduring passion for their chosen musical style, but also their stable lineup consisting of Niilo SevÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nen (bass/vocals), Ville Friman (guitar), Ville VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nni (guitar), and Markus Hirvonen (drums).\n\nRelease: 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Metal, Death Metal\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~1,000 kbps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
