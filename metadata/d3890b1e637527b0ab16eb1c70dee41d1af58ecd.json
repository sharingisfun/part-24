He has been on the forefront in EVP research, ghost photography and the use of modern technological devices to capture what goes on in the spirit world for 15 years. He has done this by being on a number of TV shows, documentaries and lectures.\n\nHis knowledge and at times skepticism, has also been important by giving real people comfort or the advice they need to delve deeper into what is going on at their homes or businesses. But most of all, he has done this by, being a sought after guest with his radio partner Barbara McBeath, for over 14 years. His perseverance to challenge what we know about the spirit world and peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind set has made him a pioneer in ghost investigating.\n\nPeople have changed their perception and what is real of ghosts from the GIS core beliefsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.they are just people. His research with Chunga has brought forth new concepts and ideas of what could be possible. Chunga and Brendan have been working together to bring this research to the public for 14 years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3890b1e637527b0ab16eb1c70dee41d1af58ecd","amp;dn":"Art+Bell%27s+Dark+Matter+2013-10-07+Ghost+Investigators+Society","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3890b1e637527b0ab16eb1c70dee41d1af58ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,137,11,30,99,117,39,176,171,22,235,28,112,222,228,29,26,245,142,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
