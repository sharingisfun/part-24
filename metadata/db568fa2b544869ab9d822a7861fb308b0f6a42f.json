Led through numerous incarnations by guitarist/vocalist Robert Smith (born April 21, 1959), the band became notorious for its slow, gloomy dirges and Smith's ghoulish appearance, a public image that often hid the diversity of the Cure's music. At the outset, the Cure played jagged, edgy pop songs before slowly evolving into a more textured outfit. As one of the bands that laid the seeds for goth rock, the group created towering layers of guitars and synthesizers, but by the time goth caught on in the mid-'80s, the Cure had moved away from the genre. \n\n  By the end of the '80s, the band had crossed over into the mainstream not only in its native England, but also in the United States and in various parts of Europe. the Cure remained a popular concert draw and reliable record-seller rhroughout the '90s, and their influence could be heard clearly on scores of new bands during the new millenium, including many that had little to do with goth.\nOriginally called the Easy Cure, the band was formed in 1976 by schoolmates Smith (vocals, guitar), Michael Dempsey (bass), and Laurence &quot;Lol&quot; Tolhurst (drums). Initially, the group specialized in dark, nervy guitar pop with pseudo-literary lyrics, as evidenced by the Albert Camus-inspired &quot;Killing an Arab.&quot; \n\n  A demo tape featuring &quot;Killing an Arab&quot; arrived in the hands of Chris Parry, an A&amp;R representative at Polydor Records; by the time he received the tape, the band's name had been truncated to the Cure. Parry was impressed with the song and arranged for its release on the independent label Small Wonder in December 1978. Early in 1979, Parry left Polydor to form his own record label, Fiction, and the Cure was one of the first bands to sign with the upstart label. &quot;Killing an Arab&quot; was then re-released in February of 1979, and the Cure embarked on its first tour of England.\n\n*Tags missing, quality is great though.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db568fa2b544869ab9d822a7861fb308b0f6a42f","amp;dn":"The+Cure+-+7+Albums+%281980-2001%29+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db568fa2b544869ab9d822a7861fb308b0f6a42f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,86,143,162,181,68,134,154,185,216,34,167,134,31,179,8,176,246,164,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
