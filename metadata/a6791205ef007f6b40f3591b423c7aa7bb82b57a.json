It was released in Europe and North America in June 1999. It was the sequel to Dungeon Keeper and predecessor to the canceled Dungeon Keeper 3. Unlike the original, Molyneux did not have an active role in the creation of Dungeon Keeper 2, though many of his ideas lived on from the previous game. Like its predecessor, players take the role of a 'dungeon keeper', building and defending an underground dungeon from the would-be heroes that invade it, as well as from other keepers. In the game's campaign mode, the player is charged with recovering the portal gems from each area in order to open a portal to the surface. This was charged as a setup for the sequel, where the gems would be used to invade the surface world and defeat the faction of goodly heroes.\nThe most immediate change from Dungeon Keeper is in its graphics; the world is now fully 3D. Where monsters were previously sprites, they are now 3D models. Several rooms, spells, and monsters were changed, added or removed, as were many game mechanics. For example, if a creature is dropped into the middle of a melee, it is stunned and vulnerable for a few seconds before getting up to fight. One major feature of the game is its &quot;My Pet Dungeon&quot; mode, which features sandbox-style play where players have a nearly unlimited amount of time to construct a dungeon uninterrupted, and wherein heroes only invade the dungeon if the player chooses to allow it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6791205ef007f6b40f3591b423c7aa7bb82b57a","amp;dn":"Dungeon+Keeper+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6791205ef007f6b40f3591b423c7aa7bb82b57a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,121,18,5,239,0,127,107,64,243,89,27,66,60,122,167,187,130,181,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
