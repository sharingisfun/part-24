The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Jewish and Christian scriptures. It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events.[13][14][15] The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance. It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.[16][17] The Quran is used along with the hadith to interpret sharia law.[18] During prayers, the Quran is recited only in Arabic.[19]\n\nSomeone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a hafiz. Some Muslims read Quranic ayahs (verses) with elocution, which is often called tajwÃ„Â«d. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during tarawih prayers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b3f2cdfc2f14f3a539dea0d17cab63239b81f17","amp;dn":"Qur%27an+Kerim+Recited+by+Sheikh+Mishary+Rashed+Alafasy+Full+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b3f2cdfc2f14f3a539dea0d17cab63239b81f17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,63,44,223,194,241,79,58,83,157,234,13,23,202,182,50,57,184,31,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
