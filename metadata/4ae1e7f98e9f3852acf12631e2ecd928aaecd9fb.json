Primary among these are the Solitude Trilogy and a brilliant documentary about Stokowski.  Also included is a piece about Casals, which I find kind of annoying.\n\nFile format is Apple Lossless.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ae1e7f98e9f3852acf12631e2ecd928aaecd9fb","amp;dn":"Glenn+Gould+Radio+Documentaries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ae1e7f98e9f3852acf12631e2ecd928aaecd9fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,225,231,249,142,159,56,82,172,241,38,49,226,236,217,40,170,236,217,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
