The shambling undead cannot resuscitate what amounts to a bland popular-history book; it rapidly begins reading like the old joke of adding &quot;in bed&quot; after the proverb in a fortune cookie. We see George Washington with zombies, Lewis and Clark with zombies, abolition with zombies, and so on and so forth. Making light of slavery, Agent Orange, and AIDS is risky business, and this book verges on the offensive with its cavalier and distasteful treatment of such subjects. Some episodes are blatantly disrespectful, like the ballroom assassination of zombie-rights activist David Z (who preferred the term &quot;differently animated&quot;). Concluding with recommendations to exterminate zombies entirely, or use them in place of animals for testing, and warning of the potential use of weaponized zombies in terrorism, the &quot;Zombie's History&quot; reads like any other tiresome polemic...with zombies.&quot;\n\nFrom Booklist Reviews:\n&quot;It was only a matter of time. Zombies have become so popular and have crossed so many genre borders that it was inevitable, sooner or later, that someone would write the Ã¢â‚¬Å“untold historyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the living undead in America. Thankfully, this is no slapdash zombie book. The author, billed as Dr. Worm Miller (in reality, Joshua Miller), has produced a completely convincing pseudo-history. From its cover illustration of zombies attacking George Washington as he crosses the Delaware to its clever insertion of the undead into real historical events (Miller explains what really happened to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“lost colonyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at Roanoke and why John Wilkes Booth really killed Abraham Lincoln) to its dead-on mimicking of textbook format and style, the book feels remarkably similar to straightforward historical writing. Miller doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t play the material for over-the-top laughs, either; this isnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Dave BarryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Zombie History of the United States. Played straight, as though it were relating real historical events, it is compelling and unsettling, like Max BrooksÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ World War Z (2006) or even Orson WellesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ War of the Worlds.&quot; -David Pitt\n\nThis torrent contains the PDF, EPUB and MOBI copies of the book - all original versions with no conversion - as well as the front cover image.
