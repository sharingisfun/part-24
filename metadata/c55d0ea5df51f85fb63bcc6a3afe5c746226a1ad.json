Through television and radio appearances, Gil was famous several years before the advent of the &quot;tropicalia&quot; scene that he and Caetano Veloso masterminded. This archival set, assembled by Brazilian music scholar Marcelo Froes, collects several of Gil's earliest known recorded works, mainly robust, slightly clattersome samba tunes, old-fashioned material that shows him rooted in the Carnaval and samba-cancao styles of the pre-bossa era. The energy and enthusiam with which Gil tackles the material is impressive: while many singers of the time strove for a cool, relaxed style, Gil tears into the songs, pouring as much power and playfulness into each performance as he can. This disc is very short timewise -- little more that twenty minutes long -- and the songs were not originally recorded with great sound quality, but the historical value is immense, and Gil's fans will love hearing him so youthful and so passionate. Recommended... but maybe only after you've become familiar with his later, more classic work.
