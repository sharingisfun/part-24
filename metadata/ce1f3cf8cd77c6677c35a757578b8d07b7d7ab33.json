Lightning clears the way for you to move forward and prayer builds shelters in a distant town where you must frequently hide to avoid being deleted into nothingness by the garbage collector. Along the way, you are thrust into many battle challenges, the outcome of which effects your shelters. There is ultimately, no way to escape the garbage collector, but running from it buys you time to think, wander, contemplate, and hopefully be at peace with the inevitability of your deletion.\n\nEach game randomly assigns you 1 of the 6 characters and 6 of the 11 areas. There is no set order to the stages of the game.\n\n\n\n\n----------------\n\nTested and working on OSX-Lion, 10.7.5\n\n----------------\n\nINSTALL:\n1. Extract the .ZIP folder.
