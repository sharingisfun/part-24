Although ostensibly light science fiction, &amp;#039;Vista&amp;#039; also containes traces of romance and more than a hint of allegory. Indeed, by the time the last word disappears, you may wonder if the story&amp;#039;s not as much about operating systems as it is about oxygen and memory and lost love.&quot;\n\n\nAbout the publisher:\n\nPirate Cove Publishing (PCP) is an experiment in distributing short-to-medium length works of fiction through The Pirate Bay and other p2p networks.\n\nSince this is the first PCP release, please consider it something of a dress rehearsal: the spirit is there, but the bones are still bare. In the future, I&amp;#039;d like to create a nicer layout and include more content -- including little extras along the lines of what you&amp;#039;d get in those old Infocom text adventure games.\n\nFor more info, see:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://piratecovepublishing.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://piratecovepublishing.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a4e90e09e8c0a772af0b38752ed21a21aa48bd4","amp;dn":"Vista+-+Pacze+Moj+%28Pirate+Cove+Publishing%29+%5B001%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a4e90e09e8c0a772af0b38752ed21a21aa48bd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,78,144,224,158,140,10,119,42,240,179,135,82,237,33,162,26,164,139,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
