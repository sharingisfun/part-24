But she saw it. Saw the gloved hand...felt the knife strike...knew her mother's terror. That was a lifetime ago. But the nightmares have returned; only, this time they're of a faceless serial killer stalking women in south Florida.

And how much can FBI agent Kyle Montgomery protect her, when he can't let go of the past they've shared?\n\nMadison is Kyle's only link to the killer, but can they find the truth before the killer strikes again?
