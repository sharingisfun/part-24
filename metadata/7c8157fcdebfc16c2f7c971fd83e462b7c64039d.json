My staff is especially crazy about the greater accuracy and ease of it. The possibility of an employee clocking someone in or out is all but eliminated by computer access security whereas if someone has a time card, they can clock the owner in or out regardless of where the owner actually may be.\n\nAttractive to the greatest number of people: Word of mouth is always the best. I'm always happy to share with other what's working for me and not. It helps that your product is not outrageously expensive. I've searched the internet looking for programs and yours was the easiest and you've been very prompt in answering queries. I appreciate that.\n\nDid you find the Employee Interface easy to use?: YES all my workers figured it out on their own.\n\nDid TimeClockWindow make time tracking easier for you?: Of course it did! it can't get much easier than point and click! No more using an adding machine so I can manually input the values into payroll.\n\nDid TimeClockWindow make time tracking easier for you?: Yes. Before TimeClockWindow I was tracking employee's time manually. At times I would forget to document when an employee reported to work and when the left, thus causing an occasional dispute over actual time worked. This moved the tracking of employee's time from me to the employees. This also eliminated any controversy over when an employee clocked-in and clocked-out.\n\nHow does TimeClockWindow compare to other time clocks?: We use an Acroprint time station with a magnetic card that the employee swipes. Cards are lost or damaged. If that occurs, I cannot just issue another card; it has to be a card with the SAME employee number since I can't change employee number in ZPAY in mid year. The replacement cards are expensive, with a delivered cost of about $5.00 to replace a specific card number. The alternative is to buy 50 cards for $150.00.\n\nHad to say all that to say this - as long as the computer works, I have a time station. Exporting data to ZPAY is more bullet proof than the ASCII export/import function for the Acro station that ZPAY graciously provides.\n\nHome page - http://www.zpay.com/timeclocksoftware.htm\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c8157fcdebfc16c2f7c971fd83e462b7c64039d","amp;dn":"ZPAY.Time.Clock.Window.v1.0.54.Incl.Keymaker-CORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c8157fcdebfc16c2f7c971fd83e462b7c64039d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,129,87,252,222,191,193,108,47,124,151,31,216,62,70,43,124,100,3,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
