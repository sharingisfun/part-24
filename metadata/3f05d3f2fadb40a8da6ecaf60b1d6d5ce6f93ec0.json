Mind maps are a visual representation of your ideas, starting with a central thought and growing from there. This allows you to brainstorm &amp; organize your thoughts in an intuitive way, so you can focus on the idea behind it.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in version 2.2:\r\n- MindNode now supports turning child nodes into Tasks. To turn a node into a Task, navigate to the &quot;Content&quot; section of the inspector and enable &quot;Task&quot;.\r\n- Parents of Tasks automatically show the current progress of your completed tasks.\r\n- MindNode integrates with Apple's Reminders. You can share your current document as a task list to Reminders. Once you shared a document to Reminders, the completion state of the tasks will sync between MindNode and Reminders.\r\n\r\nMADE IN UKRAINE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f05d3f2fadb40a8da6ecaf60b1d6d5ce6f93ec0","amp;dn":"MindNode+2.2+%5BMAC+OS+X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f05d3f2fadb40a8da6ecaf60b1d6d5ce6f93ec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,5,211,242,250,219,64,168,218,110,202,246,11,29,109,92,230,249,62,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
