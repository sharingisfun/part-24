Thats the question that has marine behavioral biologist Nate Quinn and his crew poking, charting, recording, and photographing very big, wet, gray marine mammals. Until the extraordinary day when a whale lifts its tail into the air to display a cryptic message spelled out in foot-high letters: Bite me.\n\nTrouble is, Nates beginning to wonder if he hasnt spent just a little too much time in the sun. Cause no one else on his team saw a thing -- not his longtime partner, Clay Demodocus; not their saucy young research assistant; not even the spliff-puffing white-boy Rastaman Kona (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Preston Applebaum). But later, when a roll of film returns from the lab missing the crucial tail shot -- and his research facility is trashed -- Nate realizes something very fishy indeed is going on.\n\nBy turns witty, irreverent, fascinating, puzzling, and surprising, Fluke is Christopher Moore at his outrageous best.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce236b12256db71703fbfe5da61c9d986d2ec30","amp;dn":"Christopher+Moore+-+Fluke%3A+Or%2C+I+Know+Why+The+Winged+Whale+Sings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce236b12256db71703fbfe5da61c9d986d2ec30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,226,54,177,34,86,219,113,112,63,191,229,218,97,201,217,134,210,236,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
