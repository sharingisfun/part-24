Wayne Shorter's work on soprano sax is more animated than on the previous two albums and Alphonso Johnson puts his melodic bass more to the fore. \r\n\r\nWhile not quite as inventive as its two predecessors, this remains an absorbing extension of WR's mid-'70s direction.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.Man In the Green Shirt \r\n02.Lusitanos\r\n03.Between The Thighs \r\n04.Badia \r\n05.Freezing Fire \r\n06.Five Short Stories\r\n\r\n*2002 Columbia/Legacy 507656 2\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nJosef Zawinul - Fender Rhodes, melodica, acoustic piano,, Arp 2600 synth, organ, steel drums, out, mzuthra, vocals, West Africk, xylophone, cymbals\r\nWayne Shorter - soprano and tenor saxes\r\nAlphonso Johnson - electric bass\r\nLeon Ndugu Chancler - drums, tympani, marching cymbals\r\nAlyrio Lima - percussion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeather Report - Live In Berlin 1975 (2011) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13379620/Weather_Report_-_Live_In_Berlin_1975_%282011%29_[EAC-FLAC]\r\n\r\n\r\nWeather Report - Weather Report (1971) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/12132039/Weather_Report_-_Weather_Report_%281971%29_[EAC-FLAC]\r\n\r\n\r\nWeather Report - I Sing The Body Electric (1972) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/12137689/Weather_Report_-_I_Sing_The_Body_Electric_%281972%29_[EAC-FLAC]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:269c83291af1e7e8ace06a120853467e9a737eb3","amp;dn":"Weather+Report+-+Tale+Spinnin%27+%281975%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"269c83291af1e7e8ace06a120853467e9a737eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,156,131,41,26,241,231,232,172,224,106,18,8,83,70,126,154,115,126,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
