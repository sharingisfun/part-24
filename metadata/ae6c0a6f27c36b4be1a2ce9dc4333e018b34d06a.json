It explains the systems needed to use microreactors in production and presents examples of microreactor use in different chemistries, including larger scale production processes. There are guidelines on calculating the costs and the risks of production using continuous flow microreactors. Complete with case studies, this is an essential guide for chemists and engineers interested in investigating the advantages of chemical microreactors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae6c0a6f27c36b4be1a2ce9dc4333e018b34d06a","amp;dn":"Microchemical+Engineering+in+Practice+-+Thomas+R.+Dietrich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae6c0a6f27c36b4be1a2ce9dc4333e018b34d06a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,108,10,111,39,195,107,75,225,162,206,157,196,51,62,1,139,52,208,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
