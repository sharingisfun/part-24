What you get is a clear and flat transfer. For getting a clear sound, I'll do an extended washing of each record with my RCM,\n which can take up to 30 minutes brushing on each side. Resistant ticks and clicks I try to remove as good as possible, but the priority is\n not to lose any musical information in the process. Surface noises, as long they are not too high, are left in place. Only on bad pressings\n or on records recorded at extremely low levels do I use a fade in-/-out. As John Peel said, &quot;Life is full of surface noises.&quot; In some cases\n this means that I have to make a compromise.... The result has to pass my personal quality criteria, which is IMO quite high.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd189d01cbc9b711ad538a00d3ad827289c09df7","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+AC%2FDC+-+The+Razors+Edge+%281990%29+-+2003%2C+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd189d01cbc9b711ad538a00d3ad827289c09df7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,24,157,1,203,201,183,17,173,83,138,0,211,173,130,114,137,192,157,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
