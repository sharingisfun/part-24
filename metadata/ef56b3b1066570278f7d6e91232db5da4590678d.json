Barker's backing band, the Red Clay Halo, is an unusual combination of violin, cello, accordion and flute, which shrouds Barker's songs in grand, gloomy arrangements best thought of as the approximate sonic equivalent of a Victorian mausoleum (a compliment, obviously: and they're granted two short instrumental interludes, &quot;If It's All Night Long&quot; and &quot;Serendipity,&quot; to demonstrate their chops).\n\nAt the heart of it all, Barker's intelligent, impassioned songs are carried by an extraordinary voice, as capable of the impassioned abandon of &quot;Disappear&quot; as it is of gentle, more-in-sorrow-than-anger remorse of the self-explanatory &quot;Bloated, Blistered, Aching Heart.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef56b3b1066570278f7d6e91232db5da4590678d","amp;dn":"Emily+Barker+%26amp%3B+The+Red+Clay+Halo+-+Despite+the+Snow+%5B2008%5D%5BE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef56b3b1066570278f7d6e91232db5da4590678d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,86,179,177,6,101,112,39,143,125,110,145,35,45,181,218,69,144,103,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
