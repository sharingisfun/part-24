Juarez becomes a police officer because he wants to make a difference in gang-infested neighborhoods; but, as this book reveals, he ends up a corrupt member of the most powerful gang of allÃ¢â‚¬â€the Chicago police force. Juarez shares the horrific indiscretions he witnessed during his seven years of service, from the sexually predatory officer, X, who routinely stops beautiful women for made-up traffic offenses and flirts with domestic violence victims, to sadistic Locallo, known on the streets as Locoman, who routinely stops gang members and beats them senseless. Working as a narcotics officer, Juarez begins to join his fellow officers in crossing the line between cop and criminal, as he takes advantage of his position and also becomes a participant in a system of racial profiling legitimized by the war on drugs. Ultimately, as Juarez discusses, his conscience gets the better of him and he tries to reform, only to be brought down by his own excesses. From the perspective of an insider, he tells of widespread abuses of power, random acts of brutality, and the code of silence that keeps law enforcers untouchable.\n\n320 Pages\n\nPublisher \tChicago Review Press (August 1, 2004)\nLanguage \tEnglish\nISBN-10 \t1556525362\nISBN-13 \t978-1556525360\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Brotherhood-Corruption-Silence-Brutality-Profiling/dp/1556525362/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372559286&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Brotherhood+of+corruption%3A+a+cop+breaks+the+silence+on+police+abuse%2C+brutality%2C+and+racial+profiling&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Brotherhood-Corruption-Silence-Brutality-Profiling/dp/1556525362/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372559286&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Brotherhood+of+corruption%3A+a+cop+breaks+the+silence+on+police+abuse%2C+brutality%2C+and+racial+profiling&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6a87678fb0bf0f6bf7312c34a364d7455d5fcb0","amp;dn":"Brotherhood+of+Corruption%3A+A+Cop+Breaks+the+Silence+on+Police+Ab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6a87678fb0bf0f6bf7312c34a364d7455d5fcb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,168,118,120,251,11,240,246,191,115,18,195,74,54,77,116,85,213,252,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
