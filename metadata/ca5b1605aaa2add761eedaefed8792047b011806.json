With ages ranging from 16-24 and eclectic musical tastes, matched only by their diverse cultural and social backgrounds, the bands unique sound was almost an inevitability.\n\nThe London-based collective consists of members Ali Bla Bla (rapper / producer), KoKen (rapper), Danny Wilder (lead singer / guitars / rapper), Rich Pun (guitars), Memari Man (bass), 8 Bit (synths / co-producer) and Royal (drums).\n\nThe Kings have been busy tearing down venues across the capital, headlining hotspots such as the Jazz Cafe and Cargo. Recent shows have taken their high-octane, crowd-pleasing antics across the country, steadily garnering them a large and loyal following along the way.\n\nThey recently supported Maverick Sabre on his debut nationwide tour after a releasing a series of covers on SB.TV.\n\nDriven by a shared love of music that pushes the envelope, KINGS OF THE CITY are regularly recording new material and releasing videos.\n\nLook out for their next double EP 'No Guts No Glory' in Summer 2012...\n\nWhat music in the 21st century should sound like - Jon McClure (Reverend And The Makers)\n\nA refreshing mix of raw bars, guitars, and hearts of kings! Definitely ones to watch! - Klashnekoff\n\nPositive, constructive and well produced, Ill be keeping a keen eye on them - Blade (Mark B + Blade)\n\nPushing the boundaries in a lot of ways. I am expecting great things for them in the future - Lowkey\n\nA refreshing new sound for British rap. Pure dopeness! - Charlie Sloth (BBC 1Xtra + Radio 1)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca5b1605aaa2add761eedaefed8792047b011806","amp;dn":"KINGS+OF+THE+CITY+-+Covers+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca5b1605aaa2add761eedaefed8792047b011806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,91,22,5,170,162,173,215,97,238,218,239,237,135,146,4,123,1,24,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
