This title came to my mind last week for some reason, i only had read it once from demonoid but then lost it and took the pains to find it again, im seeding it in thepiratebay so that people will have an easier time than me if they want it. \nDescription (not by me) follows:\n\nP.G.Wodehouse - Love Among the Chickens - Complete and unabridged Read by Jonathan Cecil\n\n\nJonathan Cecil is my favourite reader for P. G. Wodehouse, mainly for his rich rounded vowels, but also because he reads them unabridged, and Wodehouse is an author who rarely wrote an unnecessary word. Love Among the Chickens  opens in London, but most of the action takes place in Dorset, which the irrepressible scrounger Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge and his jolly new wife Molly have identified as an ideal place to set up a chicken farm. Counterpointing him nicely as protagonist is the nervous novelist Jeremy Garnet (Ã¢â‚¬Å“O my sainted aunt!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½), who gives Wodehouse lots of opportunity for home truths about being an author. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Among_the_Chickens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Among_the_Chickens&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44068e9b3ecfd4fe5e6556c4d05e2fc303c2a8f9","amp;dn":"P.G.Wodehouse+-+Love+Among+the+Chickens++-+Read+by+Johnathon+Cec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44068e9b3ecfd4fe5e6556c4d05e2fc303c2a8f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,6,142,155,62,207,212,254,94,101,86,196,208,94,47,195,3,194,168,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
