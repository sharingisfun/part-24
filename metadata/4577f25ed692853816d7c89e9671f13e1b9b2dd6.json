But this gift is tied to a long history of secrets that threaten to shatter her one chance at true loveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nLaken Sumner isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t your average teenager. Ever since she realized that wild animals could hear her thoughts, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spent more time in the woods with them than with other children. Even her wolf is a better friend to her than most people. She trusts himÃ¢â‚¬â€so much so that she follows him out into the wilderness in the middle of the night to find a lost little boy. But the boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappearance is only the beginning.\nThe one bright spot in her life is Noah Lawson, the handsome new town deputy. Charming and mature, he almost seems too good to be true. Then she meets Xander Payne, the new boy at school, who seems to know something about her. But how could that be possible?\nAs strange things begin to happen in her sleepy New England town, Laken wonders if Xander has something to do with it. Or is it just a coincidence that danger targets her soon after he arrives?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4577f25ed692853816d7c89e9671f13e1b9b2dd6","amp;dn":"Shadows+at+Sunset+by+Tonya+Royston+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4577f25ed692853816d7c89e9671f13e1b9b2dd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,119,242,94,214,146,133,56,22,215,200,158,150,113,241,62,27,155,45,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
