Where did the Nephilim come from? How did they return both before and after the Flood of Noah? Was there another incursion of fallen angels? Why should we be concerned about the act of mixing animal and human DNA? Why did Jesus say the Last Days would be like the days of Noah in Matthew 24:37? What differentiates the days of Noah from the days of Jared? Find out in this information packed, 2 hour seminar by Rob Skiba. â€“Rob Skiba\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€˜Fallen angelsâ€™ were generally known as â€˜Nephilimâ€™, â€˜Watchersâ€™ or â€˜Archonsâ€™, while righteous angels were known as â€˜Aeonsâ€™ or â€˜Elohimâ€™. The fallen angels or â€˜Nephilimâ€™ were banished to Earth and interbred with the Daughters of Eve as explained in the Book of Genesis (6:1-4):\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Nephilim were on the Earth in those days, and also afterwards, when the sons of God mated with the daughters of men and they bore children for them: these were the heroes of old, the men of renown.â€\r\n\r\nWhile the Book of Genesis contains references to the fallen angels as â€˜Nephilimâ€™, the Dead Sea Scrolls contain the original sources for this information. \r\n\r\nThe Book of Enoch gives a highly detailed account of the activities of 200 fallen angels or â€˜Nephilimâ€™/â€™Watchersâ€™ who were locked into a deep conflict with the â€˜righteous angelsâ€™ or â€˜Aeonsâ€™. The Nephilim proceeded to interbreed with humanity and created a race of giants that had much authority until the time of the Noah and the great flood. The Book of Enoch gives surprising validation to the theory of extraterrestrial visitation, and that this involved genetic intermixing with ancient humanity. â€“Rulers of the Earth\r\n\r\nI personally believe the fallen angels mated with human women and created the Nephilim, which were the giantsâ€”the children of the fallen angels and human women. I do not believe that they Nephilim are the same as the fallen angels, nor do I believe they have been banished. In fact, I believe the Nephilim are among us today (disembodied spirits of..), and, can possibly be living among us in a human-like form (aliens, people who are â€˜seeminglyâ€™ normal, yet who possess their spirit within their body, genetic creations, Illuminati, etc.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e3d5713f8ea7e2e35773ad43503759ad9151bdd","amp;dn":"Hidden+Secrets+-+Part+116+-+The+Archon+Invasion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e3d5713f8ea7e2e35773ad43503759ad9151bdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,61,87,19,248,234,126,46,53,119,58,212,53,3,117,154,217,21,27,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
