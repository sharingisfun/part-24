The crushing death metal is there, with pummeling blast beats and shredding guitars. They also infuse elements of thrash and black metal that increase the extremity and diversity of the music. The songs range from lighting fast traditional death metal to mid tempo tracks with a lot of groove and melody. There's even some acoustic guitars and a song that's slower and doomy. \n\nCharles Elliot is the band's vocalist, and he shows a wider range on this album as well. His death metal growls are sufficiently angry and brutal, and he also adds some menacing high pitched black metal scream and some evil whispered/spoken word vocals. Great musicianship, a lot of variety and excellent songwriting make Programmed To Consume a top notch death metal CD\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0527dedf2d85f87266f89cfc9badc1f55d9ef690","amp;dn":"Abysmal+Dawn+-+Programmed+to+Consume+%282008%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0527dedf2d85f87266f89cfc9badc1f55d9ef690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,39,222,223,45,133,248,114,102,248,156,252,155,173,193,245,93,158,246,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
