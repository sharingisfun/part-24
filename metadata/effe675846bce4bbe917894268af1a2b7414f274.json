Christian faith- oriented, but applicable to anyone of any religious or non-religious bent.  This book is hard-to-find and is usually unavailable on such sites as Amazon or eBay.  I hope this is helpful and useful to somebody.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:effe675846bce4bbe917894268af1a2b7414f274","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+Effective+Living--James+Gordon+Gilkey.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"effe675846bce4bbe917894268af1a2b7414f274","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,254,103,88,70,188,228,187,233,23,137,66,104,175,26,43,116,20,242,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
