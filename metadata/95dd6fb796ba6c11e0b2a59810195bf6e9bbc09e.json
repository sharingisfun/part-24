Cooper, whose haunting Dark Mission novels set a new standard for paranormal romance, carries readers into the shadows of a very different Victorian London, where science skirts the line between magic and mechanics. A magnificent talent writing in the vein of such paranormal and urban fantasy superstars as J.R. Ward, Jeaniene Frost, Gail Carriger, and Meljean Brook, Cooper introduces readers to a truly remarkable heroine: Cherry St. Croix. Debutante by day and bounty hunter by night, Cherry makes a truly smashing debut in Tarnished, as she trawls the seedy underbelly of an alternate London in search of a killerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and finds herself at odds with the dangerousÃ¢â‚¬â€and dangerously handsomeÃ¢â‚¬â€criminal kingpin, Micajah Hawke, ruler of the Midnight Menagerie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95dd6fb796ba6c11e0b2a59810195bf6e9bbc09e","amp;dn":"Tarnished+by+Karina+Cooper+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95dd6fb796ba6c11e0b2a59810195bf6e9bbc09e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,221,111,183,150,186,108,17,224,178,165,152,16,25,91,246,233,187,192,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
