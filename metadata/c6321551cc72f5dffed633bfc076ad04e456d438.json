The 7:44 am train. Cars packed with commuters. One woman occupies her time observing the people around her. Opposite, a girl puts on her make-up. Across the aisle, a husband strokes his wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hand. Further along, another woman flicks through a glossy magazine. Then, abruptly, everything changes: a man collapses, the train is stopped, and an ambulance is called.\nFor at least three passengers on the 7:44 on that particular morning, life will never be the same again. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lou, in an adjacent seat, who witnesses events first hand. Anna, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sitting further up the train, impatient to get to work. And Karen, the manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife.\n\nTelling the story of the week following that fateful train journey, One Moment, One Morning is a stunning novel about love and loss, about family and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ above allÃ¢â‚¬â€œ friendship. A stark reminder that, sometimes, one moment is all it takes to shatter everything. Yet it also reminds us that somehow, despite it all, life can and does go on.\n.\n.\nThe Two Week Wait - AZW3 + EPUB + MOBI\nAfter a health scare, Brighton-based Lou is forced to confront the fact that her time to have a baby is running out. She canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t imagine a future without children, but her partner doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to feel the same way, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure whether she could go it alone. Meanwhile, up in Yorkshire, Cath is longing to start a family with her husband, Rich. No one would be happier to have a child than Rich, but Cath is infertile. Could these strangers help one another out? Combining Sarah RaynerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deft exploration of raw emotions with the joy and resilience of friendship, The Two Week Wait is a memorable, moving page-turner about two very different women, each yearning to create a family of her own.\n.\n.\nThis is a multi-tracker torrent.
