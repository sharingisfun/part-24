Ranging from critical topics such as the understanding of language to the meaning of meaning, inward speech to the relationship between erotic sensibility and linguistic convention, these eight essays posit myriad topics for exploration and dialogue. George Steiner deals with considerations that are simultaneously literary and philosophical, exploring themes of linguistic privacy and the changing technical, physiological, and social statuses of the act of reading.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f20c3551b0535c4ff82aea59c76356b97adee308","amp;dn":"On+Difficulty+-+George+Steiner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f20c3551b0535c4ff82aea59c76356b97adee308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,12,53,81,176,83,92,79,248,42,234,89,199,99,86,185,122,222,227,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
