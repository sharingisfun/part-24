It has full VCD/DVD playback functionality. KMPlayer is a versatile media player which utilizes all kinds of video information and subtitles to bring the best video experience through software/hardware options and recognition of various display devices. The player provides a strong hybrid structure efficient for interconnecting various directshow filters, winamp input&amp;dsp plugin, and internal filters. The most outstanding feature is that the player has the full control of filter connections to prevent a media playback from being messed. KMPlayer handles a wide range of subtitles and allows you to capture audio, video, and screenshots in many ways. The player provides both internal and external filters with a fully controlled environment in terms of connections to other splitters, decoders, audio/video transform filters and renderers without grappling with the DirectShow merit system.Internal filters are not registered to userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s system to keep it from being messed up with system filters.\n \nThe KMPlayer includes almost all the essential decoders required for media playback. Furthermore, to get beyond the limitation of internal decoders, the external ones such as commercial h.264 decoders or cyberlink/intervideo audio decoders can be specified, so that KMP works optimally by the usersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ own customization. Even though the KMP is based upon directshow structure, it supports Winamp, Realmedia and Quicktime by the internal logic.

It is completely customizable thanks to a wide selection of skins and color schemes, and the configuration options are extremely extensive.\n \nKMPlayer developed by a South Korean engineer and is well known for stable engine and various features and used by millions of users every day. In order to develop the KMPlayer to the next level to accommodate growing needs from all over the world, Pandora TV, the largest video streaming company in Korea has acquired the technology including the source code and core engine for the KMPlayer from the original developer, Kang Yong-Huee on August, 2007.\n \nFeatures:\n KMP has required codecs built-in.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Enjoy medias without installing codecs separately.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ KMP supports both built-in and 3rd party codecs.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ KMPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s built-in codec is faster and reliable because it process internally.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The current built-in codec supports all ffdshow codecs and also codecs that ffdshow doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t support such as MPEG1, 2.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Features audio codecs (AC3, MPEG1, 2, AAC, WMA 7, 8 etc.).\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Matrix/normalizer options through built-in voice codec.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Through KMPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s built-in codecs, you can enjoy all major media formats.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ KMP additionally supports 3rd party codecs for users that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t use the built-in codec and also doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t install the codecs on the computer like other codecs do.

Minor corrupted AVI files can be viewed through previous versions of AVI Splitter.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ If it still doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t play, KMP will utilize the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“AVI Source FilterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for playback. The built-in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“AVI Source FilterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ analyses AVI files and plays by skipping bad frames.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ If it still doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t play through the above methods, it will utilize the RealMedia engine to play the corrupted AVI files.\n \nVarious File Format Support &amp; Hardware Support\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ KMP is based on DirectShow so it supports almost all Windows Media formats.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ KMP also supports Winamp, RealMedia, QuickTime, Flash(SWF) through KMPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ground-up technology.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ KMP supports the most media formats compared to all worldwide media players.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ KMP supports DirectShowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extension WDM(TVs/cameras) and DVDs..\n \nVarious Options\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Various ratios supported (4:3, 16:9. 2.35:1, 1.85:1 etc.)\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Playback speed options.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Various subtitle options.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Standard Video Setup: Soften/Sharpen/Blend Color/Reverse Input/Reverse\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Advanced Video Setup: Remove Afterimage/Remove 3D Noise/Remove Noise in Phases/Add Noise/Fast Forward Mode etc.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Manage still images, video captures, filters etc.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Flash format supported (FLV, SWF).\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Watch Live URL broadcasts (VOD, MMS).\n \nLanguage: 25 languages supported (Albanian, Arabic, Belarusian, Bosanski, Brazilian, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnam)\n \nChanges in KMP+ 3.1.0.0 R2:\n - Fixed MKV Source Filter.\n \nHomepage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ http://www.kmplayer.com/forums/\n \nSize: 21.5 MB\n\nThis is a new updated build of previous beta version i have uploaded few days ago now : Release 2 = R2\nThis new version should working fine even if you have already installed vlc media player.No conflict anymore between both program now :)\nTested and works ok for me.\nComes directly from KMP forums and has been released just today so.\nI just added the date of its release to the end of the title of the file.\nAnyway : clean,untouched and delivered such &quot;as is&quot; so.\nEnjoy and seed a bit,please.\nHave a nice day end\nbest regards\nNote :\nBeware,Pandora service is silently installed as &quot;momo service&quot; during setup \ninstallation of KMP.If you don't want it,don't forget to uninstall this afterwards so.\nYou will have to decline two other adwares aswell...\ncheers ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eac2964c3e975a016190b56e38102e924c096c97","amp;dn":"KMPlayer_EN_3.1.0.0_R2-December+20%2C2011.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eac2964c3e975a016190b56e38102e924c096c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,194,150,76,62,151,90,1,97,144,181,110,56,16,46,146,76,9,108,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
