Written in 1808 it is clearly the forerunner to the Ninth Symphony where the work was expanded altered and adapted by Beethoven into a symphonic form. This version by Vladimir Ashkenazy and The Cleveland Orchestra and Cleveland Orchestra Chorus dates from 1988.\n\nThis version is in Flac lossless and includes the CD box cover image. I use Media Monkey, which is free and allows you to incorporate the album art work, leaflets etc. Have a look at Media Monkey if you don't already use it.\n\nI am unable to seed constantly so please allow for me being off-line from time to time until the seed has gone into a swarm.\n\nEnjoy and keep the classical music coming! Share the world!\n\nxxx\n\nDue to popular interest I have been asked to add further info so here it is ---\n\nSoprano - Mary Shearer\n2nd Soprano - Teresa Cash\nAlto - D'Anna Fortunato\nTenor - Jon Garrison\nBaritone - Terry Cooke\n2nd Baritone - Martin Horning\nChorus Director - Robert Page\n\nThe orchestra is conducted from the piano by Vladimir Ashkenazy himself.\n\nThe main theme of the Choral Fantasy was borrowed from 'Gegenlieb' a song set by Beethoven in 1795 which was at the time unpublished.\n\nI have an extensive library so if you would like further classical works leave a comment here. Also, it would be interesting to here views from other music lovers so any comments would be nice (join Piratebay to enable comments - its free and anonymous).\n\n\nMore about Beethoven -\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beethoven&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88bacdff7ee73b8e5b9e856c324d114651fec5ce","amp;dn":"Beethoven+-+Choral+Fantasy+Op.+80+-+Ashkenazy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88bacdff7ee73b8e5b9e856c324d114651fec5ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,186,205,255,126,231,59,142,91,158,133,108,50,77,17,70,81,254,197,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
