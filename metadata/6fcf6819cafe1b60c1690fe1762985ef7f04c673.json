Chelsea could go top of the Premier League with victory at Hull. Jose Mourinho's side beat Hull 2-0 at Stamford Bridge on the opening day of the season but the Tigers are not to be underestimated at home having already beaten Liverpool at the KC Stadium this term. Elsewhere, Swansea City return to Manchester United a week after knocking them out of the FA Cup. There are relegation six-pointers between Fulham and Sunderland and Cardiff City versus West Ham United. Everton meet Norwich City, Southampton play West Brom and Tottenham Hotspur take on fellow Londoners Crystal Palace.\n\n\nNotes: I've done this at 50fps to give smoother, more fluid movement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fcf6819cafe1b60c1690fe1762985ef7f04c673","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2014-01-11+720p+50fps+HDTV+x264-wAm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fcf6819cafe1b60c1690fe1762985ef7f04c673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,207,104,25,202,254,27,96,193,105,15,225,118,41,133,239,127,4,198,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
