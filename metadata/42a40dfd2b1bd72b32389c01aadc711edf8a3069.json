Whether itâ€™s sharp, fuzzy, poignant or thrilling, itâ€™s the glue that binds our mental lives. Without it weâ€™d be prisoners of the present, unable to use the lessons of the past to change our future. From our first kiss to where we put our keys, memory represents who we are and how we learn and navigate the world.\r\n\r\nBut how does it work? For the first time, using cutting-edge research, neuroscientists are exploring the precise molecular mechanisms of memory.\r\n\r\nBy studying individuals ranging from an 11-year-old whiz-kid who remembers every detail of his life since age eight, to a man who had his spider phobias vanquished, to a woman who even had memories implanted, scientists have uncovered a provocative idea. For much of human history, memory has been seen as a tape recorder that faithfully registers information and plays it back intact.\r\n\r\nBut now, researchers are discovering that memory is far more malleable, always being written and rewritten, not just by us but by others. As we are discovering the precise mechanisms that explain and can even control our memories, the question is â€“ are we ready?\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 961 MiB\r\nDuration : 53mn 7s\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 529 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42a40dfd2b1bd72b32389c01aadc711edf8a3069","amp;dn":"PBS+NOVA+Memory+Hackers+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42a40dfd2b1bd72b32389c01aadc711edf8a3069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,164,13,253,43,27,215,43,50,56,156,1,170,220,113,30,223,138,48,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
