What does Emma know about the accident, and why does Thayer seem to know more about the situation even though he has been in L.A.? Sutton's friends are tired of the lies and demand answers from Emma. Not exactly knowing the whole story surrounding Eduardo's accident, will Emma finally tell Mads and Char about the switch to save their friendship, or will she risk it to save Sutton's secret?
