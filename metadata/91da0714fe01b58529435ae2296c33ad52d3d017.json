There have been a number of releases for Rush lately from concert footage to documentaries. For a band who is as prolific and influential as they are I say it's high time more stuff has been put out there. While the recently released documentary, Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage, gives a lot of details spanning their entire career this disk delves into great detail Rush's two most important albums. While the band has released more than 20 albums these two bookend the five albums that defined them as the ultimate power trio and masters of the progressive/art rock genre.\n2112 was Rush's fourth (third with drummer Neil Peart) album and it was created out of a mixture of defiance, anger, and pure sense of uncompromising. Their album Fly by Night made critics take notice and Caress of Steel made them disregard the band out of hand. 2112 not only make them take notice again, but it caused a frenzy from just word of mouth. This documentary goes into the thought process behind this. Not only the &quot;we are gonna do this album our way&quot; and &quot;if we are going out we are going on our terms&quot; kind of thinking, but also the music theory behind the songs written and the long play format of the titular 2112 suite (consisting of an entire side of a vinyl album.\nSo you have that breakaway album, and then Rush makes a couple more critically acclaimed concept albums, then two albums that take the band to a more radio-friendly arena. This is where Moving Pictures comes in. As the last of the albums of this genre it marks the band's complete departure from the art-rock/long form suites (The album Permanent Waves still had the multi-themed Natural Science) to single concept, self contained songs ready for airplay. This album also marks Rush's greatest hit single to date with Tom Sawyer.\nAgain this doc goes into not only the thinking of where they were going with Moving Pictures as a band, but also the musicality of the various songs (and studio theories and techniques). It's a good message Rush says when the changes they went through on each of these albums were something they did all for themselves and for the love of music. This documentary really shows how a band can change their (for lack of a better word) shtick and still be true to who they are.\nYou get some great early footage from studio to concerts and more as well as current interviews with each band member. You get to see the breakdown of many of the songs of each album and how they were put together both instrumentally and post production. You also get interviews with Terry Brown, Rush's studio producer and engineer from both albums and each one in between. All in all this is a great resource for anybody who loves these two albums.\nWhat's cool is the extras, which is about an hour of additional interviews and concert footage not shown in the original airing on Classic Albums. That's like getting twice the show in one disk. If you are a fan of the classic Rush this disk is worth going for. If you are a serious music fan and enjoyed the song Tom Sawyer I think this will be a very informative and enjoyable disk to have in your collection as well. If you have been collecting all of the other Rush videos believe me; there is still stuff in here you don't have.\n\nTechnical\nGeneral\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 2.13 GiB\nDuration : 58mn 10s\nOverall bit rate : 5 235 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2014-05-17 00:50:36\nWriting application : MakeMKV v1.8.10 darwin(x86-release)\nWriting library : libmakemkv v1.8.10 (1.3.0/1.4.1) darwin(x86-release)\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Video\nFormat version : Version 2\nFormat profile : Main@Main\nFormat settings, BVOP : No\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default\nCodec ID : V_MPEG2\nCodec ID/Info : MPEG 1 or 2 Video\nDuration : 58mn 10s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 4 939 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 9 800 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nOriginal display aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nStandard : NTSC\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Interlaced\nScan order : Top Field First\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.477\nStream size : 2.01 GiB (94%)\nLanguage : English\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDuration : 58mn 10s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 79.9 MiB (4%)\nTitle : Stereo\nLanguage : English\n\nSutitles\nLanguage : English\nLanguage : German\nLanguage : Spanish\nLanguage : French\nLanguage : Italian\nLanguage : Dutch\nLanguage : Portuguese\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91da0714fe01b58529435ae2296c33ad52d3d017","amp;dn":"Classic+Albums+-+Rush+%282112+%26amp%3B+Moving+Pictures%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91da0714fe01b58529435ae2296c33ad52d3d017","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,218,7,20,254,1,181,133,41,67,90,226,41,108,51,173,82,211,208,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
