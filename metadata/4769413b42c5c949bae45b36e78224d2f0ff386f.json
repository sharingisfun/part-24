Whether it is upgrading your connection to one of the new superfast fibre lines, switching provider, or simply wringing more speed out of the connection you have already got, this guide has plenty of practical advice on how to do it. We look at the potential of the heavily promoted 4G mobile network, and ask if they might even replace the need for a landline broadband connection. We will also help you to work out what spend you actually need from your provider and how to avoid falling foul of the small print in their contracts. We have also got detailed advice on equipment including how to avoid Wi-Fi dead spots. There s also a chapter full of advice on staying safe online, so great if you have children or if you just want to know how to secure your broadband connection and mobile devices.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4769413b42c5c949bae45b36e78224d2f0ff386f","amp;dn":"Instant+Guide+Issue+1+-+2014++UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4769413b42c5c949bae45b36e78224d2f0ff386f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,105,65,59,66,197,201,73,186,228,91,54,231,130,36,210,240,255,56,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
