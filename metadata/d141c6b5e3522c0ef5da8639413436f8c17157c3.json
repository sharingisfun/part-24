The two musicians had not played together since the 1960s, so their collaborations during the one day of recording were quite spontaneous and fresh. Rowles sets the quiet mood, and Pass keeps his amplifier quite low and was content to play on the pianist's turf. The emphasis is on slower tempos and harmonically sophisticated chords. Together they explore such songs as &quot;What's Your Story Morning Glory,&quot; &quot;As Long as I Live,&quot; &quot;Stardust&quot; and &quot;T'is Autumn.&quot; Superior background music that rewards close listening. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - What's Your Story, Morning Glory\n02 - So Rare\n03 - As Long As I Live\n04 - Marquita\n05 - Stardust\n06 - We'll Be Together Again\n07 - Can't We Be Friends\n08 - 'Deed I Do\n09 - T'is Autumn\n10 - God Bless The Child\n\nEnjoy and share!
