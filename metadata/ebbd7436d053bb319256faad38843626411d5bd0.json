It was formed in 1981 as a supergroup, with former members of Yes, King Crimson, Emerson Lake and Palmer, and The Buggles.\n\nAsia&amp;#039;s eponymous debut album enjoyed considerable commercial success, spending nine weeks at number one in the U.S. album chart. The singles &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot; and &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; became huge Top 40 hits, with the latter cracking the Top Five, and remaining a stadium favourite at U.S. sporting events.\n\nThe tracks from the Asia debut have stood the test of time and are played on classic rock stations throughout the world today. The Asia debut has become legendary in the genre of classic rock. &quot;Sole Survivor&quot; also received heavy air play on rock stations across the US.\n\nThe US tour also did extremely well, selling out every date on the &amp;#039;82 and &amp;#039;83 tours, while the MTV channel played their videos on heavy rotation. Billboard named the Asia debut as album of the year.\n\nThe power ballad &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Cry&quot; entered the Top Ten in 1983, while &quot;The Smile Has Left Your Eyes,&quot; a fan favourite for John Wetton vocal performance, charted inside of Billboard&amp;#039;s top 40. But Rolling Stone panned Alpha as an over-produced commercial album [3], while others lamented that Howe and Palmer were effectively reduced to session musicians. However, many Asia fans favour Alpha over the debut. The tracks &quot;Eye To Eye&quot; and &quot;My Own Time&quot; became huge fan favourites. &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Heat Goes On&quot; became concert staples. Alpha received indifferent reviews from various critics, while still attaining platinum status. Alpha reached #6 on the USA Billboard album chart.\n\n\nDiscography\n\n    * 1982 - Asia (Downes, Wetton, Howe, Palmer) #1 US, #15 JP\n    * 1983 - Alpha (Downes, Wetton, Howe, Palmer) #6 US, #4 JP\n    * 1985 - Astra (Downes, Wetton, Meyer, Palmer) #67 US, #15 JP\n    * 1986 - Aurora (Japanese-only EP) #66 JP\n    * 1990 - Then &amp; Now (New tracks: Downes, Wetton, Lukather, Komie, Meyer, Gorham, Palmer) #114 US, #24 JP\n    * 1992 - Aqua (Downes, Payne, Howe, Pitrelli, Palmer, Glynne, Phillips, Gloker) #21 JP, #51 GE\n    * 1994 - Aria (Downes, Payne, Pitrelli, Sturgis) #20 JP, #89 GE\n    * 1996 - Arena (Downes, Payne, Sturgis, Ibrahim, Randall, Hotei, Jardim) #48 JP\n    * 1996 - Archiva 1 (Downes, Payne, Howe, Pitrelli, Gorham, Glynne, Dessent, Sturgis, Glockler, Nye)\n    * 1996 - Archiva 2 (Downes, Payne, Pitrelli, Randall, Gorham, Glynne, Dessent, Palmer, Sturgis, Glockler, Thornton, Hayman, Nye, Jardim)\n    * 1997 - Anthology (New tracks: Downes, Payne, Sturgis, Randall, Ibrahim)\n    * 1999 - Rare (Downes, Payne)\n    * 2001 - Aura (Payne, Downes, Howe, Crichton, Randall, Thrall, Govan, Slade, Sturgis, Colaiuta, Jardim, Levin) #115 GE\n    * 2004 - Silent Nation (Downes, Payne, Govan, Slade) #77 GE\n\n\n\nEncoded with lame 3.97 -V4 --vbr-new (~170 kbit/s) and should be close to perceptual transparency.\n\n\nKids, always remember Xenu is your friend.\n\nwww.xenu.net\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebbd7436d053bb319256faad38843626411d5bd0","amp;dn":"%5BProgressive+Rock%5D+Asia+-+Alpha+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebbd7436d053bb319256faad38843626411d5bd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,189,116,54,208,83,187,49,146,86,250,173,56,132,54,38,65,29,91,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
