New laws which were passed in secret, just before the summit, resulted in a legal landscape which violated much of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. With over 19,000 police officers and security personnel on hand, the results lead to over 1100 arrests, martial law in downtown Toronto, and the most massive violation of civil liberties in Canadian history. The whole world is watching.\n\n\n\nGenre: Documentary | Crime | History\nIMDB Rating: N/A\nDirected By: Dan Dicks\nRelease Name: Into.The.Fire.2011.DVDRip.DivX-NoGRP\nSize: 1.45 GB\nVideo: XviD | 720ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€416 | 1484 Kbps | 23.976 fps\nAudio: English | AC3 | 192 kbps\nRuntime: 2h 3mn\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1abca22c145b7b9cdf92eeca3f1e0afc2de35b3","amp;dn":"Into.The.Fire.2011.DVDRip.DivX-NoGRP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1abca22c145b7b9cdf92eeca3f1e0afc2de35b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,171,202,34,193,69,183,185,205,249,46,236,163,241,224,175,194,222,53,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
