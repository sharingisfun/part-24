Blue Pariah was designed to push the limits of the neo-swing movement of the late 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s. More then any other BRJ CD, this album mixes the raw elements of blues, jump, jazz, swing, cabaret, ska and punk in a way that no one could imagine at the time. It was designed to be the Ã¢â‚¬Å“alternativeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ swing album, for people who really wanted something different.
