The island, with its deserted lighthouse, general store/bar/inn, and two sullen inhabitants easily seems mysterious. Add to that a few guarded, secretive visitors and this isolated atmosphere needs little imagination-on the part of reader or characters-to make ordinary circumstances seem sinister, perhaps murderous. Although the story is sparse, there's intrigue, sex and, more importantly, Spanish artist Prado's sumptuous illustrations and exquisite use of colors, to keep the reader's attention. Starting with vividly clear greens and blues, the colors change with the mood of the narrative, with lavender-streaked shadows moving in as the mystery grows, while deeper blues and reddish browns signal violence and loss. A fine first title from NBM's just launched ComicsLit imprint of graphic novels from around the world.
