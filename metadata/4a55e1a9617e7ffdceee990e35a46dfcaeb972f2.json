It is one of the Gabriel &amp; Dresden remixes, 99% sure it's the bootleg version.\n\nI'll be seeding this for a while, but I'll strongly encourage others to do it as well. As always :)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a55e1a9617e7ffdceee990e35a46dfcaeb972f2","amp;dn":"Coldplay+Clocks+Remixes+%26+Reworks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a55e1a9617e7ffdceee990e35a46dfcaeb972f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,85,225,169,97,126,127,253,206,238,153,14,53,164,109,252,174,185,114,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
