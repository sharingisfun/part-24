This is a rare and valuable treasure that helps one to be successful in day-to-day life. \nIn Kanda Sashti Kavasam the author prays to Lord Muruga to shower His grace. It is certain that by regular chanting of this kavasam all the predicaments of life are resolved. As a warrior going to battle puts on an armour to protect himself, the Kanda Sashti Kavasam also helps one to be safe in day-to-day life.\n\nA few words about Sashti\n\nSashti is the day Lord Subramanya defeated the demon Soorapadman and saved\nthe Earth. When the Devas couldn&amp;#039;t tolerate the evildoings of this demon they approached the son of Lord Shiva and Parvati. The kind Lord went on a war against Soorapadman. The war was waged for six days, at the end of which the Lord vanquished the asura. He threw his weapon at him and Soorapadman was split into two halves. One half became a peacock, which Muruga took as His vehicle. The other became a cock and was transformed into his flag.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dfb941542cd45ef3b86231b0d874c5627fd8bb4","amp;dn":"SKANDHA+SASHTI+KAVASAM+By+Sulamangalam+Sisters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dfb941542cd45ef3b86231b0d874c5627fd8bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,251,148,21,66,205,69,239,59,134,35,27,13,135,76,86,39,253,139,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
