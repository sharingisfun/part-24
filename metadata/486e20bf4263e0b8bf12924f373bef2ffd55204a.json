Knowles launched her family's fashion line, House of DerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©on, in 2004, and has endorsed such brands as Pepsi, Tommy Hilfiger, Armani and L'OrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©al. In 2009, Forbes listed Knowles fourth on its list of the 100 Most Powerful and Influential Celebrities in the world, third on its list of the top-grossing musicians, and number one on the list of top Best-Paid Celebs Under 30 with over $87 million dollars in earnings between 2008 and 2009.\n\nKnowles has attained five Hot 100 number one singles, becoming one of the two female artistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½joint with RihannaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with the most number ones attained within the 2000s, excluding her three Hot 100 number one singles with Destiny's Child.
