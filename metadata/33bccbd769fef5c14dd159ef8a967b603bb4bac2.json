Sam Eddy's piano work on &quot;It's Party Time&quot; is rock &amp; roll at its irreducible best, while the guitar work here tips its hat to Duane Eddy regularly.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/intoxica-the-best-of-the-revels-r209190&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/intoxica-the-best-of-the-revels-r209190&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003H0M&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003H0M&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
