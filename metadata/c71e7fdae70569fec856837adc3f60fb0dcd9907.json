However, with all of this change comes new features that may catch old-school Windows users off guard. In The Complete Idiot's Guide to Microsoft Windows 8, veteran tech writer Paul McFedries uses his friendly style and wit to comfort experienced Windows users and newbies alike by explaining all the new features, as well as the old, and helping everyone overcome trepidation about using this completely updated look to the most popular desktop operating system in the world. Readers will learn how to use new features including tiles and the new home screen, how they can mesh their data with &quot;the cloud,&quot; and much more. And, when all else fails, McFedries teaches users how they can easily and seamlessly toggle back to the &quot;old&quot; and familiar Windows look and feel, should the new experience prove to be a bit more change than desired.\n\nTitle: The Complete Idiot's Guide to Windows 8\nAuthor: Paul McFedries\nPublisher: ALPHA\nSeries: The Complete Idiot's Guide\nISBN: 1615642366, 978-1615642366\nYear: 2012\nFormat: PDF\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
