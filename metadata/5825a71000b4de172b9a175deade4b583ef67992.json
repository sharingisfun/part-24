But Chet really did like to sing, and you'll hear some of his best here. Sometimes his vocals get so soft you have to turn up the volume just to hear him. Once again, Chet has surrounded himself with excellent musicians, particularly the great Harold Danko. Danko and Jon Burr also contribute some original material for Chet.\nmuzik62\n\n------ Tracks -----------\n1. Swing Shifting (7:20)\n2. Round Midnight (10:30)\n3. Caravelle (5:47)\n4.
