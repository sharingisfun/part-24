It was released on the Dutch Rave-On Records, who also released the first mini LP Ã¢â‚¬ËœNuns Have No FunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ by MERCYFUL FATE back in 1983.\n\nEVIL was among the first metal bands to define the genre speedmetal back in 1984, by sharp vocals, heavy riffs and Freddie WolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fast and pounding bassdrums. At the time, the band wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t presenting the typical heavy metal, but today the band is among the founding fathers of European heavy metal.\n\nThe band split up back in the mid-eighties and drummer Freddie kept on playing with a bunch of established Danish rock-acts and soloists, but the metal has been there ever since in the background. 2015 is the year for Freddie to unleash EVIL again with the new album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shoot The MessengerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Freddie wrote all the music, wrote the lyrics, played all instruments and produced the new album himself. The vocals where done by longtime friend SÃƒÂ¸ren Nico Adamsen (ex-Artillery). The album is mixed and mastered by the Austrian Frank Pitters (Edenbridge, Visions Of Atlantis, Dignity).\n\nEVILÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound anno 2015 is classic heavy metal in the vein of Accept and Judas Priest whom inspired EVIL back in the early eighties. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shoot The MessengerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ consists of 8 songs, or warnings if you please, about the worlds situation today and how we all in the end are responsible for the evil and bad things going on on the planet and in our own lives.\n\nEVILÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Shoot The MessengerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will be released on March 30th 2015 via Mighty Music.\nType:\n    Full-length\n\nRelease date:\n    March 30th, 2015\n\nCatalog ID:\n    PMZ129\n\nLabel:\n    Mighty Music\n\n\n1. \tIt's Here \t          02:02 \t \n2. \tDarker Side of Mother Nature \t04:20 \t \n3. \tShoot the Messenger \t03:16 \t \n4. \tI Could Be Your Hero \t04:30 \t \n5. \tBig Show \t         03:22 \t \n6. \tKeep It True \t        05:23 \t \n7. \tMove \t               03:51 \t \n8. \tWorld War 666     \t05:20 \t \n  \t32:04 \t \n\n\n\n Lineup\n\n Freddie Wolf\tBass\nSee also: ex-Palladion\t\n\t\n\nFreddie Wolf \tDrums\nSee also: ex-Palladion\t\n\nFreddie Wolf \tGuitars\nSee also: ex-Palladion\t\n\nSÃƒÂ¸ren Nico Adamsen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals \t\n\n\nBut the real deal is Freddy the drummer,also the guitarist and the bass.\nHe also wrote the lyrics and music, but he dont sing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d0a29b34e0cee464affb1919ad465f0176d9d86","amp;dn":"Evil+-+Shoot+The+Messenger++2015+ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d0a29b34e0cee464affb1919ad465f0176d9d86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,10,41,179,78,12,238,70,74,255,177,145,154,212,101,240,23,109,157,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
