Every week we field live calls from atheists and believers alike, and you never know what you're going to get! Sometimes it can get quite feisty indeed! You don't want to miss it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Atheist Experience is produced by the Atheist Community of Austin. The Atheist Community of Austin is organized as a nonprofit educational corporation to develop and support the atheist community, to provide opportunities for socializing and friendship, to promote secular viewpoints, to encourage positive atheist culture, to defend the first amendment principle of state-church separation, to oppose discrimination against atheists and to work with other organizations in pursuit of common goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis torrent includes entire Atheist Experience podcasts for 2008, all downloaded from the site for archiving, and sorted, and renamed and tagged with Easytag, for ease of reading, etc. All in MP3 format, with cover art embedded","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:492ff49e9658ad9ee5bbe819620e1200c2335165","amp;dn":"The+Atheist+Experience+%282008%29+%28Podcasts+-+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"492ff49e9658ad9ee5bbe819620e1200c2335165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,47,244,158,150,88,173,158,229,187,232,25,98,14,18,0,194,51,81,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
