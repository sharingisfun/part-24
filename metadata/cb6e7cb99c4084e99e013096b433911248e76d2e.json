Several remakes and Ports of Counter-Strike have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux.\n\nSet in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams that include counter-terrorists and terrorists. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else killing all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.\n\nAs of August 2011, the Counter-Strike franchise has sold over 25 million units","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb6e7cb99c4084e99e013096b433911248e76d2e","amp;dn":"Counter+Strike+%28CS%29+1.6+Original+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb6e7cb99c4084e99e013096b433911248e76d2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,110,124,185,156,64,132,233,158,1,48,150,180,51,145,18,72,231,109,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
