The player can move one ball per turn to remove balls by forming lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) of at least five balls of the same color. If the player does form such lines of at least five balls of the same color, the balls in those lines disappear, and he gains one turn, i.e. he can move another ball. If not, three new balls are added, and the game continues until the board is full.\n\nMobile OS \tAndroid OS 2.2, Android OS 2.3, Android OS 2.3.3, Android OS 2.3.6, Android OS 2.3.7, Android OS 4.0.3, Android OS 4.0.4, Android OS 4.2.x, Android OS 4.3.x, Android OS 4.4.x","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89ad8dede6ff0f143a29e3013a947c2902ba57c3","amp;dn":"Classical+Lines+98","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89ad8dede6ff0f143a29e3013a947c2902ba57c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,173,141,237,230,255,15,20,58,41,227,1,58,148,124,41,2,186,87,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
