In narration, he describes his enjoyment of reading banned books, his despair of his small-town existence and his dreams of leaving for college. Arriving for his first day of junior year, Ethan notices newcomer Lena Duchannes, who resembles the girl he has been dreaming about. The other students do not take kindly to her and spread gossip regarding her reclusive uncle, Macon Ravenwood, and her family being devil worshippers. Overhearing these whispers, Lena tenses and the classroom windows shatter, amplifying the fears and suspicions of the class and the townspeople at large that she is a witch.\n\nOn a drive home, Ethan nearly runs over Lena, whose car has broken down. He gives her a ride home and the two bond over their shared love of poetry and having both lost their mothers. Ethan drops Lena off but later finds a locket and returns to the mansion to give it to her as a present. The touch of the locket triggers a shared flashback to the Civil War, after which he awakens at his home. Macon disapproves of their growing romance and conspires with Ethan's family friend, Amma, to keep the two separated but Ethan persists and Lena confesses that she and her family are &quot;casters&quot;, capable of performing a variety of magical spells such as changing the weather and illusion casting. On her 16th birthday, Lena's true nature will steer her towards either the light or the dark and Lena fears being consumed by evil and hurting those she loves. Ethan insists she is responsible for her own choices and that regardless of her insecurities she is a good person.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98ea9446b035ee7122775f190f5a792f673477f7","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Creatures.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98ea9446b035ee7122775f190f5a792f673477f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,234,148,70,176,53,238,113,34,119,95,25,15,90,121,47,103,52,119,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
