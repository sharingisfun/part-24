Her daughter, Trudy, was only three when she and her mother were liberated by an American soldier and went to live with him in Minnesota. Trudy's sole evidence of the past is an old photograph: a family portrait showing Anna, Trudy, and a Nazi officer, the Obersturmfuhrer of Buchenwald.\n\nDriven by the guilt of her heritage, Trudy, now a professor of German history, begins investigating the past and finally unearths the dramatic and heartbreaking truth of her mother's life.\n\nCombining a passionate, doomed love story, a vivid evocation of life during the war, and a poignant mother/daughter drama, Those Who Save Us is a profound exploration of what we endure to survive and the legacy of shame.\n\n\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:606fbc1c3f404cb592647acdd50511237ff64fdd","amp;dn":"Jenna+Blum+-Those+Who+Save+Us+%28ePUB%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"606fbc1c3f404cb592647acdd50511237ff64fdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,111,188,28,63,64,76,181,146,100,122,205,213,5,17,35,127,246,79,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
