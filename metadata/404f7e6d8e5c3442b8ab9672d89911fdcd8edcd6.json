The result is Naturally Sweet Food in Jars, preserving in the tenor of todayâ€™s health-conscious audience. .

The book is organized by sweeteners, and includes recipes like Sriracha-style Hot Sauce (using honey), Date Pancake Syrup (with maple), Cantaloupe Basil Jam and Marinated Multicolored Peppers (both sweetened with agave), and Fennel and Parsley Relish (sweetened with fruit juice). Her trademark flavor combinations, seasonal awareness, and manageable small batches are here, too, for her longtime readers and a whole new audience, and are just as sweet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:404f7e6d8e5c3442b8ab9672d89911fdcd8edcd6","amp;dn":"Naturally+Sweet+Food+in+Jars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"404f7e6d8e5c3442b8ab9672d89911fdcd8edcd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,79,126,109,142,92,52,66,184,171,150,114,216,153,17,253,205,142,220,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
