Mockingbird Lane. \n\nMockingbird Lane, based on executive producer Bryan Fuller's script and directed\nby executive producer Bryan Singer, is a new, reÃƒÂ¯magined version of the classic \n1960s comedy The Munsters, now as a visually spectacular one-hour drama with a \ndarker edge and tone. \n\nThe cast includes Jerry O'Connell as Herman Munster, Portia de Rossi as his wife\nLily, Eddie Izzard as Grandpa, Mason Cook as Eddie, and Charity Wakefield as \nMarilyn.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~         Rip  Notes         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis is for all the folk in Detroit who were fucked over by their NBC station,\nWDIV, and were treated to some local All 4 Halloween show followed by a repeat \nof Jeopardy! instead of Mockingbird Lane. WDIV just also happens to be the NBC\nstation that is carried on most cable and satellite services in Canada. \n\nEven though the Canadian viewers don't count for the US ratings WDIV managed to \nkeep the show from being seen by easily 12 - 15 MILLION people on the continent.\nWay to go you idiots.\n\nAnd for those who care about US ratings, Detroit is the 11th largest market in\nthe US with not quite 2 million people. More than a few people from Detroit \nwrote to Ellen on facebook, twitter, etc. because they wanted to see the show \nand Ellen's wife stars in the show. And yes, Ellen's syndicated talk show is\ncarried by WDIV :P \n\nMaryanne Marie Beetle, who first appears in the Wonderfalls episode &quot;Muffin \nBuffulo&quot; and has subsequently appeared in the Pushing Daisies episode &quot;Comfort \nFood&quot;, appears in the pilot of Mockingbird Lane.\n\nIf you can, do buy the episode from iTunes, Amazon, or wherever. It might help\nNBC decide to continue the show. And you'll get the subtitles. \n   \n                                 Proudly Fullerian\n                                         \n                                     ~ hugs ~\n\n            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~          Cheers to         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Jaye   Gretchen   George  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f286f88ef3e0a6d4f5063fec26d96644d4b4a30c","amp;dn":"Mockingbird.Lane.s01e01.Pilot.720p.WEB-DL.AC3.h264-jAh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f286f88ef3e0a6d4f5063fec26d96644d4b4a30c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,134,248,142,243,224,166,212,245,6,63,236,38,217,102,68,212,180,163,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
