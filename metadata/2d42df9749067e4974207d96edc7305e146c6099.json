The last few years, the Straight Arrow team has been looking for good sounding amateur recordings from this particular season, and we are pleased to announced that we finally succeeded in locating two very good tapes obtained directly from the person who recorded them.\n\n Most of the fans know that this is the engagement where Priscilla told Elvis that she was leaving him. Very little else seems to stand out for the casual observer. In many ways that's a pity, because this engagement is crucial on a number of levels. Firstly, because it represented a return to form. The early '72 Vegas shows surprised both the critics and fans because of Elvis' serious commitment to his music and his no-nonsense delivery. \n\n These shows marked also the first time that he performed the now-legendary &quot;Theme 2001&quot; / &quot;C. C. Rider&quot; opening, plus he also introduces various new songs to the show that are now widely considered as his finest show additions from the 70s, including &quot;A Big Hunk OÃ¢â‚¬ËœLove&quot;, &quot;You Gave Me A Mountain&quot;, &quot;Never Been To Spain&quot;, &quot;IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Remember You&quot; and &quot;An American Trilogy&quot;. Actually, the best-ever versions of &quot;Trilogy&quot; are from this engagement!\n\n As a bonus, we added the only known live-performance of &quot;I'm Leaving It All Up To You&quot; from the February 10th, 1972 Midnight show.\n\n Both shows are strong and focused and they give the listener a good impression of Elvis' renewed interest in his music and his stage performances. These concerts are previously unreleased and they are presented in their complete form and in the best possible sound quality. \n\n\nEnjoy!\nThanks to the original uploader!\nJeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d42df9749067e4974207d96edc7305e146c6099","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-To+live+and+die+in+Dixie+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d42df9749067e4974207d96edc7305e146c6099","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,66,223,151,73,6,126,73,116,32,125,150,237,199,48,94,20,108,96,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
