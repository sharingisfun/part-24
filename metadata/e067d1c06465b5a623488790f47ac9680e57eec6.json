So the\nzoo keeper and his assistant try to stop them or apprehend\nthem when they do. They also have schemes which the zoo\nkeeper has to take care of.\n\nMeet Hair Bear, Square Bear and Bubi Bear, three of the\nheppest, savviest and silliest ursines to ever crash a\ncave. And what a cave! From its seemingly stone and straw\ndÃƒÂ©cor the whole hole transforms at the touch of a button\ninto one swinging, scientific and super bachelor pad.\nThe only drawback? ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inside a zoo! But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ok,\n'cauz quick-talking Hair (voiced by Daws Butler),\nbefuddling curlicue talker Bubi (voiced by ventriloquist\nsupreme Paul Winchell) and master of the invisible\nmotorcycle, the zen-drawling Square Bear\n(voiced by William Callaway) are more than a match for\nkeepers Mr. Peevly (voiced by John Stephenson) and\nBotch (voiced by Joe E. Ross). And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not to mention\nthe other delightful denizens of Wonderland Zoo, who are\nalways ready to help (and sometimes hinder) the Bears in\nthe bigger-than-the-zoo schemes.\nThis product is manufactured on demand using\nDVD-R recordable media.\n\nOriginal SOURCE: DinoRider/DVD9/BitHQ &lt; Cheers\nVideo: MP4/H264/720*400/23fps\nAudio: AAC/2ch/128Kbps\nEng Subs Included: NO\nSample Included: Yes\nFile Size: (1.76GB x2 / 3.56GB)\n\nCode: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066667/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066667/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e067d1c06465b5a623488790f47ac9680e57eec6","amp;dn":"Help.It%60s.The.Hair.Bear+Bunch.The.Complete.Series.DVDRip.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e067d1c06465b5a623488790f47ac9680e57eec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,103,209,192,100,101,181,166,35,72,135,144,244,122,201,104,14,87,238,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
