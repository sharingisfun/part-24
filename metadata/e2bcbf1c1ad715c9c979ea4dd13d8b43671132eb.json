He lost his way, battling his inner demons by challenging any cowboy unfortunate enough to get in his way. No one seems to be able to cool him down, except beautiful Bodie Mays. Bodie doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind saving Cane from himself, even if he is a little too tempting for her own peace of mind. But soon BodieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the one who finds herself in need of rescuing Ã¢â‚¬â€ only, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s afraid to tell Cane whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really going on. How can she trust someone as unpredictable as this fierce cowboy? When her silence only ends up getting her into even deeper hot water, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Cane to save the day. And if he does it right, he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be riding off into the sunset alone. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Palmer demonstrates, yet again, why sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the queen of desperado quests for justice and true love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Publishers Weekly on Dangerous\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
