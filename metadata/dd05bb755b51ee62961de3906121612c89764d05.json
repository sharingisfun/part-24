Carroll\r\nWadsworth Publishing | January 2015 | ISBN-10: 130525337X | 672 Pages | True PDF | 28.9 mb\r\n\r\nWith its fresh, fun, and hip approach, SEXUALITY NOW: EMBRACING DIVERSITY, 5E, helps teach readers what they need and want to know about sexuality while clearly conveying foundational biological and health issues and citing current and classic research. The new edition continues answering the questions and concerns that readers have about themselves and their sexuality with scientific fact, sensitivity, humor, and unmatched candor. Carroll presents the range of sexual orientations and behaviors and takes into account the current social, religious, ethnic, racial, and cultural contexts. This edition includes even more examples and research on sexual diversity both within and across cultures.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author \nhttp://s14.postimg.org/91vm9xb5t/janell.jpg\r\nDr. Janell Carroll received her Ph.D. in human sexuality education from the University of Pennsylvania in 1989.
