Johnny's a straight-up bluesman, after all, a white-hot guitarist with roots in the Texas soul of T-Bone Walker and Charlie Christian. Little brother Edgar, a keyboard and saxophone prodigy, has more eclectic tastes, with his own albums ranging from jazz-tinged instrumental funk to space-prog epics.\n\nThe joke is that even on 1992's Hey, WhereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Your Brother--a phrase both of them must hear a dozen times a day--Edgar only joins his big brother on a few tracks, a soulful rendition of Charles Brown's blues classic &quot;Please Come Home for Christmas&quot; being a clear highlight. Another treat is the sassy &quot;You Must Have a Twin,&quot; one of the non-twins' few co-written songs. The whole album bristles with good humor and genial attitude, making it one of the most enjoyable items in either brother's catalogue.\n\nTracklist\n\n1. Johnny Guitar {[3:26]\n2.
