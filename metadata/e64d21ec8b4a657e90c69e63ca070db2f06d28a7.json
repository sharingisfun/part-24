Maritime was funded by a kickstarter campaign and there are subtle contributions from drummer Andre Lauher, Christopher Merill (on bass); Mike Grigon (lap steel); Jerome Holloway (harmony vocals on Helicopter); and Sarah Von Dassow (cello), not forgetting FerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own distinctive guitar work.\nI particularly liked the languid charm of Could Be Ghosts, the persuasive power of Dark Dark Woods and the highlight song, Conspiracy of Ravens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e64d21ec8b4a657e90c69e63ca070db2f06d28a7","amp;dn":"Dave+McGraw+%26amp%3B+Mandy+Fer+-+Maritime+%5B2014%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e64d21ec8b4a657e90c69e63ca070db2f06d28a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,77,33,236,139,74,101,126,144,198,158,99,202,7,13,178,240,109,40,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
