A band releasing a live DVD after having played only two gigs (and this concert being the second one), but it's Shermann/Denner from Mercyful Fate and then it might seem a little less unusual.\nIt's HEAVY FUCKING METAL right from the start and despite most of the Swedish audience (concert was played in Stockholm) doesn't seem to know the songs of Force of Evil (who can blame them when it's just the second gig the band ever did?), they're still very enthusiastic and headbanging along to the heavy tunes of The Calling, Mindbreaker, Hell On Earth etc.\nNot surprisingly, 8 of the show's 11 songs are from the first Force of Evil album. I personally think they've chosen the best songs of that record and they play them extremely skilled. It's very obvious that they've gone through many rehearsals before they went out to play these songs live.\nFifth song of the concert is classic The Curse of The Pharaohs extremely well played, and despite Martin Steene not being King Diamond, he actually sings it pretty well. The audience is really hooked here!\nThe last song is from the upcoming album, Black Empire and is called Death Comes Crawling. A brand new song that the Swedes were the first to experience live (lucky bastards! ) It really makes a great promise for the second FOE album!\nThe encore is another Mercyful Fate classic. EVIL. &quot;I was born on the cemetary under the sign of the moon raised from my grave by the dead&quot;. Though it ain't as good as when King Diamond sings it, it's still a great song that Steene adopts in a nice way.\nThe extra material features interview with the band where you'll hear that Michael Denner collects rare records, Steene works in a hospital and Bjarne Holm is always busy playing music to make a living.\nIncluded is also the studio version of the brand new song, Death Comes Crawling. I actually like the live version better, but it's still a cool song. Dead-heavy and evil.\nWe also get a little insight from the studio but I found this to be of little interest. Very poor picture and sound quality and despite the possibility to select subtitles, it's just plain boring.\nFinally there also are some video footage of the band's first concert ever (Cleveland, Ohio). Rather poor picture quality, but the sound is as good as the main concert on the disc.\nIf you like classic old school metal, this DVD is for you. The only real bad thing about it is the length of the main concert, but I'm looking forward to another live DVD sometime in the future when the band has more material to choose from. But despite the length, it's a cool concert. Really cool guitar playing from the heavy metal masterminds, Hank Shermann and Michael Denner.\nÃÂ¢Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂµÃÂºÃÂ»ÃÂ¸Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘â€š:\n01. The Calling\n02.
