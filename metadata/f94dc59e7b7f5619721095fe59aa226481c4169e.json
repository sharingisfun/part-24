The file says about 9 Gigs but it's more about 12 Gigs\n\nI couldn't find a recent ME 1 wineskin that was compatible with OSX Lion...so I made one!!\n\nComputer Specs:\n\nMac OSX Lion 10.7.3\n2.3 GHz Intel Core i5\n8GB 1333 MHz DDR3\nIntel HD Graphics 3000 512 MB\n\nNote: \n\nShould work ideal with Nvidia graphics cards; should work with AMD/ATI graphics cards, but I have heard problems with the Snow Leopard 10.6.8 version of Mass Effect 1 and AMD/ATI cards. If there are problems with my Lion version, especially with any graphics cards, post it in comments. I won't be able to troubleshoot though as it is a compatibility issue between the graphics card itself and ME 1. If there are no problems still post and praise this torrent, so at least I'll know if mine is better :)\n\nAlso:\n\nThis Mass Effect 1 contains both DLC packages\n   #1 Bringing Down the Sky\n   #2 Pinnacle Station\n\nLook forward to more uploads in future friends!!\n\nPLEASE Donate for the work that I do...it takes forever.\n\nHere is the link to send money to me in paypal\n\n\n1. mark friend or family\n2.
