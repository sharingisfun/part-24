The Fallen Angels were formed in 1966 and recorded two LPs for the Roulette label. Both of the albums have been re-released on separate CD's as The Roulette Masters Parts 1 &amp; 2. The music of the Fallen Angels was aimed for a pop audience as the label was trying to repeat the success of it's major act, Tommy James and The Shondells. It proved that The Fallen Angels were much too &quot;far out&quot; for the commercial radio audience and despite good sales of the first album, the band was dropped by their label after recording a second album entitled Its A Long Way Down. Both album remain prime examples of psychedelic pop music which many band's in the late 90's are trying to copy. ~ Keith Pettipas\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfbe80f058aa39116062623ebc7a65a989289582","amp;dn":"The+Fallen+Angels...The+Roulette+Masters+Part+2+Of+2%281968%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfbe80f058aa39116062623ebc7a65a989289582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,190,128,240,88,170,57,17,96,98,98,62,188,122,101,169,137,40,149,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
