Hollenback, Michael B. Schiffer, J. M. Skibo and William Walker\nEquinox Publishing | October 2010 | ISBN-10: 1845532880 | PDF | 230 pages | 29.7 mb\n\nThis book is a synthesis of the fundamental method and theory of behavioral archaeology, organized in terms of the temporal order in which general topics have been addressed. The development of key ideas is recounted in relation to the historical contexts in which they emerged. Among the major topics addressed are philosophy of science and the scientific method, artifacts and human behavior, archaeological inference, formation processes of the archaeological record, technological change, behavioral change, and human communication. Case studies make clear the relevance of behavioral method and theory for the everyday practice of archaeology. Not only has behavioral archaeology successfully elucidated the nature of archaeological inference and demonstrated the importance of dealing with formation processes in every aspect of archaeological research, but it also furnishes a highly original approach for studying and explaining behavioral and technological change. The main message of the book is that behavioral archaeology, which privileges the study of people-artifact interactions at every scale, furnishes a coherent, mature, and still-developing program for conducting archaeological research in any society, past or present.\n\nAbout the Author\nMichael Brian Schiffer is the Fred A. Riecker Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the University of Arizona, where he has taught since 1975. His interests include archaeological method and theory, behavioral change, technological change, ceramic technology, and history of electrical and electronic technologies.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface Michael Brian Schiffer\nI.
