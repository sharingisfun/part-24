Coro\nEdits:  Michael Eury\n\nFresh from his success in Legion of Super Heroes (1989) Annual #3 comes Timber Wolf, the rough-and-tumble beast-man whose heart is in the right place...even if the rest of him usually isn't. Set in the 20th century, TIMBER WOLF is a hard-hitting action-adventure story about our hero's encounter with Thrust, a new character with a major streak of ultra-violence! You'll also meet Point Force, a government-sanctioned group of paranormals, who can't, at first, decide whether to incarcerate Timber Wolf or recruit him.\n\nThanks goes to DobisP.R. for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba2ba1f3edceaf370b1446c5680683d77c8bf6e8","amp;dn":"Timber+Wolf+01+%281992-11%29+%28DobisP.R.-Novus-HD%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba2ba1f3edceaf370b1446c5680683d77c8bf6e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,43,161,243,237,206,175,55,11,20,70,197,104,6,131,215,124,139,246,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
