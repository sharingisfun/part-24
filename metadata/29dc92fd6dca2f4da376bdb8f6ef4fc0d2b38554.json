The real treat here is Lucky Thompson's tenor sax. The Don Byas-influenced Thompson has a sound that invites the listener to luxuriate in its grace and strength. Thompson solos on &quot;Mood Indigo&quot; with a sublime, breathy legato, adding bite and rougher edges -- without sacrificing nuance or subtlety -- on Jackson's &quot;Minor Conception&quot; and &quot;Soul in 3/4.&quot; For his part, Jackson reels off a fluid stream of shifting, seamless, advanced blues -- his time, phrasing, and execution all exquisite. In the rhythm section, Hank Jones (piano), Wendell Marshall (bass), and Kenny Clarke (drums) support with the ego-free artistry expected of the Savoy house band of the day. Jackson's Ville is one of four Savoy CDs that pair Jackson with Thompson. The others are The Jazz Skyline, Roll 'em Bags, and Meet Milt Jackson. Each on its own is short measure (Jackson's Ville clocks in at 30 minutes). As a collection, though, they comprise a vital document that sits nicely alongside Jackson's and Thompson's work with Miles Davis from this period. [AMG Review]\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
