Formerly known under the name Murder Therapy, the band released their debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Symmetry of DeliriumÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 2009, which showed a very personal mix of modern dissonant death metal.\n\nA more broadened approach to songwriting became audible in the 2011 self-released Ep Ã¢â‚¬Å“MolochianÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which marked a stylistical step forward towards more experimental and atmospheric compositions. The Ep gained international momentum and put the band on the radar in the underground metal scene.\n\nRecording sessions for a new album took place at Regrexion Studios with Michele Trasforini throughout the summer of 2011 and was then mixed and mastered at Studio73 in Ravenna with producer Riccardo Pasini (Ephel Duath, The Secret, etc.) in November of the same year.\n\nDuring the course of 2012 the band changed name to Nero di Marte, the name the album was originally given and subsequently signed to Prosthetic Records who released the album worldwide in mid-March 2013.\n\nNERO DI MARTE will release &quot;Derivae,&quot; the highly anticipated follow-up to their self-titled debut, this fall. The album's title, taken from the Italian phrase &quot;andare alla Deriva&quot; (&quot;to go adrift&quot;, correlates with its lyrical themes, which vocalist Sean Worrell describes as &quot;tragically searching for something that maybe isn't there...letting yourself go and becoming swayed by the unknown.&quot;\n\nThree years in the making, &quot;Derivae&quot; was recorded, mixed and mastered using 100% analog and without use of any digital post-processing with Riccardo &quot;Paso&quot; Pasini at Studio73 (Ephel Duath, Void of Sleep).\n\nCritical acclaim came pouring in for their 2013 Prosthetic debut, including a near-perfect review from Revolver (which described the band as the &quot;gifted and talented love child of 'Leviathan'-era Mastodon and latter-day Death&quot;. NERO DI MARTE has since continued to keep audiences in awe appearing on treks throughout Europe with acts including Godflesh, Carcass, Immolation, Cynic, Decapitated, Red Fang and Svart Crown, as well as completing their first ever North American jaunt last year supporting Gorguts and Origin.\n\nBANDMEMBERS:\n\nSean Worrell - Vocals, Guitars\nFrancesco D'Adamo - Guitars\nAndrea Burgio - Bass\nMarco Bolognini - Drums\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
