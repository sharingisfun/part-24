Here he meets Angel, the world-weary, opium-addicted chanteuse who becomes a pawn in a life-and-death game of wits between Scott and Ramon. \nThe Loser is the episode that is required viewing for anyone who wonders why Bill Cosby earned an Emmy for I Spy&amp;#039;s first season. Some credit should go to Robert Culp -- this is one of the best of his seven scripts. Eartha Kitt earned an Emmy nomination of her own for her portrayal of a truly lost soul.\n\nLocation: Hong Kong\n\nDVD&gt;XviD/416x304/29.97fps\nMP3/48kHz/120kbps/50min\n\nLeave a comment for more iSPY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65f3e1b60f25c24932ddcb10085fa64acc93a5a1","amp;dn":"i+SPY+106+The+Loser+%5Bretr%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%C2%A2tv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65f3e1b60f25c24932ddcb10085fa64acc93a5a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,243,225,182,15,37,194,73,50,221,203,16,8,95,166,74,204,147,165,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
