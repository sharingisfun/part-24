When Edward the Black Prince marched out of Gascony in August 1356, his plan was to carry out a large-scale destructive raid into the territory of the French King, John II. On 18 September, however, he was cornered south of Poitiers by a larger French army, and was left with little option but to fight. The ensuing battle proved an unmitigated disaster for the French.

In this volume, Dr David Nicolle details a campaign that enhanced the reputation of the Black Prince and led King John to catastrophe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a9ee3c284820d5736ffd74b3a81c50ad9160bbd","amp;dn":"Poitiers+1356%3A+The+Capture+of+a+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a9ee3c284820d5736ffd74b3a81c50ad9160bbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,158,227,194,132,130,13,87,54,255,215,75,58,129,197,10,217,22,11,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
