Xu, Q. Shi (Springer, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-319-32320-6\r\nStructure and Bonding (Book 168)\r\n\r\nChemical structure and bonding. The scope of the series spans the entire Periodic Table and addresses structure and bonding issues associated with all of the elements. It also focuses attention on new and developing areas of modern structural and theoretical chemistry such as nanostructures, molecular electronics, designed molecular solids, surfaces, metal clusters and supramolecular structures. Physical and spectroscopic techniques used to determine, examine and model structures fall within the purview of Structure and Bonding to the extent that the focus is on the scientific results obtained and not on specialist information concerning the techniques themselves. Issues associated with the development of bonding models and generalizations that illuminate the reactivity pathways and rates of chemical processes are also relevant. The individual volumes in the series are thematic. The goal of each volume is to give the reader, whether at a university or in industry, a comprehensive overview of an area where new insights are emerging that are of interest to a larger scientific audience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7844bcb5357fc0ea21342467801133b13356f2f","amp;dn":"Structure+and+Modeling+of+Complex+Petroleum+Mixtures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7844bcb5357fc0ea21342467801133b13356f2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,132,75,203,83,87,252,14,162,19,66,70,120,1,19,59,19,53,111,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
