Meanwhile, a struggle for supremacy rages between the gods and the Titans. Dangerously weakened by humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lack of devotion, the gods are losing control of the imprisoned Titans and their ferocious leader, Kronos, father of the long-ruling brothers Zeus, Hades and Poseidon. The triumvirate had overthrown their powerful father long ago, leaving him to rot in the gloomy abyss of Tartarus, a dungeon that lies deep within the cavernous underworld. Perseus cannot ignore his true calling when Hades, along with ZeusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ godly son, Ares (Edgar RamÃƒÂ­rez), switch loyalty and make a deal with Kronos to capture Zeus. The TitansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ strength grows stronger as ZeusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ remaining godly powers are siphoned\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Fantasy\nIMDB Rating: 6.1/10 from 25,318 users\nDirected by: Jonathan Liebesman\nStarring: Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson and Rosamund Pike\n\nRelease Name: Wrath.Of.The.Titans.2012.720p.BluRay.x264-REFiNED\nSize: 4.37 GB\nVideo: MKV | 1280Ãƒâ€”720 | 4112 kbps\nAudio: English | DTS | 1510 kbps\nRuntime: 99 min\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcf61c883e0576d73f6462cd2aab456c7ff11d0a","amp;dn":"Wrath.Of.The.Titans.2012.720p.BluRay.x264-REFiNED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcf61c883e0576d73f6462cd2aab456c7ff11d0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,246,28,136,62,5,118,215,63,100,98,205,42,171,69,108,127,241,29,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
