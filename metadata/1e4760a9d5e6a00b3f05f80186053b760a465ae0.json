Jean-Paul Gaster from Clutch met Opeth keyboardist Per Wiberg at the Sounds of the Underground Tour. They jammed together, and allowed other musicians to join them, with the motto of &quot;get funky or get out&quot;. Later, they gathered at a home Wiberg rented in Sweden, and invited Kamchatka guitarist Thomas Andersson and Ulf Rockis Ivarsson, among others, to record an album in one week. The band has thus far released one self-titled album. The band is called &quot;a triumph of musicianship drawing on all the talent at the groups disposal.&quot;\n\nMembers\n\nThomas Juneor Andersson (Kamchatka) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar\nJean-Paul Gaster (Clutch, Bakerton Group) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nUlf Rockis Ivarsson (Beatundercontrol) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\nPer Wiberg (Mojobone, Spiritual Beggars, Opeth) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, guitar, vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e4760a9d5e6a00b3f05f80186053b760a465ae0","amp;dn":"King+Hobo+-+King+Hobo%5B2008%5DMP3-192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e4760a9d5e6a00b3f05f80186053b760a465ae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,71,96,169,213,230,160,11,63,5,248,1,134,5,59,118,10,70,90,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
