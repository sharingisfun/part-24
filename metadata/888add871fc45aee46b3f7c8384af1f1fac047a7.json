Wagner is perfect as the college kid psycho coolly removing the pregnant Woodward from his life.\n\nThis isn't your typical 1950's movie, and it certainly isn't the type of movie you'd expect from squeaky-clean leading man Robert Wagner. With the implication of premarital sex, the use of the word &quot;pregnant&quot; and a rather shocking murder scene, A KISS BEFORE DYING was a very adult film for the mid-1950s, a time when the motion picture industry still was in the throes of censorship. As for Robert Wagner, he made a very smart choice by accepting such a dark role in this noir-ish thriller.\n\nUtilizing his squeaky-clean screen persona as a cover, Wagner portrays a character whose outward appearance is that of the all American boy, but who is in reality a cold, calculating schemer not above committing brutal murder to get him everything he wants out of life.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 451mb\nDuration.... 01:26:19\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 632\nFrame Height.... 264\nData Rate.... 645kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 82kbps\n1 Channel mono\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:888add871fc45aee46b3f7c8384af1f1fac047a7","amp;dn":"A+Kiss+Before+Dying+1956+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"888add871fc45aee46b3f7c8384af1f1fac047a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,138,221,135,31,196,90,238,70,179,247,200,56,74,241,241,250,192,71,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
