Now, you must return to where it all began Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the town of Tristram Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and investigate rumors of a fallen star, for this is the first sign of evilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rebirth, and an omen that the End Times have begun.\n\nShake the earth, blast your enemies with fire and ice, summon otherworldly minions and much more as you wield the powers of your heroic birthright.\n\nLay waste to legions of evil throughout randomized, 3D environments. Face innumerable demonic villains, uncover quests in new locations, and claim different loot every time you play. No two games are ever the same.\n\nUse the Real Money Auction House to buy and sell items for real world currency. Then draw on your earnings to buy ever more powerful items or cash out your trades, take the money, and run. The choice is yours.\n\nFrom the fabled spires of Caldeum to the besieged walls of BastionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Keep, the mortal world has fallen under the corrupting influence of infernal powers. Aid in SanctuaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defense as it teeters on the brink of demonic annihilation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fedf6a51b8488ba7f6b6f4e7e358d7e207a67698","amp;dn":"Diablo-III-8370-enGB-Installer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fedf6a51b8488ba7f6b6f4e7e358d7e207a67698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,223,106,81,184,72,139,167,246,182,244,231,227,88,215,226,7,166,118,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
