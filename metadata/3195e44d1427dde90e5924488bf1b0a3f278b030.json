It includes brand new recordings of favourites 'Molly Green' and 'Star', Storer's version of 'Mallee Girl' plus duets with Josh Cunningham, Paul Kelly and brother Greg Storer. The live tracks include 'Dungarees' with The Sunny Cowgirls and 'Christmas In The Country' with Shane Howard. There are 37 tracks all up in this collection of music.\n\nSara Storer has become one of Australia's most celebrated musical storytellers and is now releasing her first Greatest Hits collection. Talk to people about Sara Storer and the same words keep being used: 'real', 'unaffected', 'authentic'. It's partly a way of acknowledging that she's lived the life she sings about - growing up on a farm in Victoria's Mallee, her grandfather a pioneer of the district, then teaching in tiny bush towns in Queensland and the Northern Territory. \n\nBut authenticity alone doesn't make a great artist. Sara has a hungry writer's eye, her songs full of vivid, telling moments and narratives that seem to drop the listener into a freshly minted world. The voice that tells these tales is open and unguarded; the music seductive yet energised. Her songs speak with great directness and immediacy, as if we had found ourselves on the road, or round the campfire, with the characters of the song. \n\nSara won the Best New Talent award at the 2001 Country Music Awards, and then - in 2002 - released her second album Beautiful Circle, this time with the stand-out song 'Raining on the Plain', a duet with John Williamson. By 2004, with that record haul of Golden Guitars, there was no stopping her. Two more acclaimed albums followed - Firefly (2005) and Silver Skies (2007). \n\nNow here is the excellent Best Of Sara Storer.\n\nCD 1\n1. Buffalo Bill\n2. Back Out Back\n3. Beautiful Circle\n4.
