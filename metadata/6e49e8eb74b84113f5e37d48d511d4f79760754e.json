The 2011 Red Bull X-Alps DVD tells the story of this yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s epic race. Thirty athletes from 22 countries raced 864km along the length of the Alps in either a paraglider or a pair of mountain boots.\n\nThe 52-minute documentary chronicles the exhaustion and elation of the pilots as they battled their way from Salzburg to Monaco. All the action is caught in the film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from spectacular flights past iconic mountains to terrifying take-offs in dire conditions.\n\nUsing footage shot by camera crews and the athletes themselves, the Red Bull X-Alps DVD gives an intimate portrait of the mental and physical endurance required to complete the challenge.\n\nJust 11 days after setting off, Christian Maurer (SUI) was the first to reach the finish line of Monaco. Only one other pilot completed the journeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e49e8eb74b84113f5e37d48d511d4f79760754e","amp;dn":"Red+Bull+X-Alps+2011.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e49e8eb74b84113f5e37d48d511d4f79760754e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,73,232,235,116,184,65,19,245,227,125,72,213,17,212,247,151,96,117,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
