Six men drowned, and the resulting court-martial became a national media sensation putting the future of the corps into question. Written by a senior historian at the Marine Corps Historical Center, The U.S. Marine Corps in Crisis explores the social, political, and historical context of this tragic moment in U.S. military history as a case study in how bureaucratic institutions undertake internal reform and offering a valuable vantage point on tensions in American society during the 1950s.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 325 pages\nPublisher: University of South Carolina Press (November 30, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1570038848\nISBN-13: 978-0872496354\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6894d7a08425afc4ba1c9ef8dc57bede5d9560fa","amp;dn":"The+U.S.+Marine+Corps+in+Crisis%3A+Ribbon+Creek+and+Recruit+Traini","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6894d7a08425afc4ba1c9ef8dc57bede5d9560fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,148,215,160,132,37,175,196,186,28,158,248,220,87,190,222,93,149,96,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
