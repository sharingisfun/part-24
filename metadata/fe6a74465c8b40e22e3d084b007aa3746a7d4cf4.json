The hard parts of life are love and hope. From a touching relationship between Jonathan and his aging great aunt, to an inebriated evening with an amorous, octogenarian dwarf, to the devastating aftermath of 9/11, Ames&amp;#039;s first original graphic novel, with gritty, poignant art by Dean Haspiel (THE QUITTER), tells a story at once hilarious, excruciating, bizarre and universal, about how our lives fall to pieces and the enduring human struggle to put things back together again.&quot; \n\nThanks to The Ramones for scanning this GN, and Demonoid member jmm2112 for uploading it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe6a74465c8b40e22e3d084b007aa3746a7d4cf4","amp;dn":"Alcoholic+Hardcover+%282008%29+%28c2c%29+%28The+Ramones-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe6a74465c8b40e22e3d084b007aa3746a7d4cf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,106,116,70,92,139,64,226,46,61,8,75,0,122,163,116,106,125,76,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
