It featured the main heroes of the DC Universe. \n\nThe story begins as a young alien woman named Dusk arrives on Earth to warn the population that a giant extraterrestrial being, known as the Sun-Eater, is heading our way. Dusk is a member of an unknown alien race, and does not speak or understand a word of English, so Saturn Girl uses her telepathic powers to translate and teach her the language. Dusk has attempted to warn hundreds of worlds, prior to Earth, about the Sun-Eater. Each planet had tried, in its own way, to stop the Sun-Eater, but every attempt was as unsuccessful as the last one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e8f079c4786a7746540fd0506cbdff9a7272aab","amp;dn":"27.The+Final+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e8f079c4786a7746540fd0506cbdff9a7272aab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,143,7,156,71,134,167,116,101,64,253,5,6,203,223,249,167,39,42,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
