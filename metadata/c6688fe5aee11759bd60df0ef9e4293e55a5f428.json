Tracks are presented chronologically, \nso you can finally add a definitive archive of this material to your own CD \ncollection. All tracks have been sourced from vinyl, CD or cassette - no lossy MP3s \nhave been used in the making of this compilation.\n\nDISC ONE - &quot;Another Another Monty Python Record&quot;\n\n1-21 ANOTHER MONTY PYTHON RECORD (ORIGINAL UK VERSION)\n\nThe original British vinyl version of this album, painstakingly restored in CD \nquality.\n\nÃ¯Â¿Â¼It's a little known fact that there are two versions of 1971Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Another Monty Python \nRecord. It's an even lesser known fact that the version used for every single CD \nrelease, a great deal of the cassette versions, and even a few vinyl editions, is \nthe wrong version.\n\n22 LUMBERJACK SONG (SINGLE VERSION)\n\n\n23 YANGTSE SONG (SINGLE VERSION)\n\n\n24 THE SINGLE\n\nA very rare American promo item, this 7&quot; bravely attempted to condense the Matching \nTie And Handkerchief album onto one side of a 45, in both mono and stereo. It has \nbeen rebuilt in stereo using a vinyl transfer and the 2006 CD remaster of the \nalbum.\n\n25-26 MONTY PYTHON'S TINY BLACK ROUND THING\n\nThis flexidisc, given away with the NME, presents the Election Night \nSpecial/Lumberjack Song section of Live At Drury Lane in a looser, unedited form.\n\n27-28 INSTANT RECORD COLLECTION\n\nTwo exclusive items from the 1977 Instant Record Collection compilation - an \nalternate intro to &quot;Alistair Cook Being Attacked By A Duck&quot; and the complete \n&quot;Summarising Proust Competition&quot; sketch originally cut from Previous Record. These \nhave been restored from the now-deleted CD release of the album, which had poor top \nend and a surprisingly problematic hiss issue.\n\nDISC TWO - &quot;Farewell To Dave Herman&quot;\n\n1-31 MONTY PYTHON EXAMINES THE LIFE OF BRIAN\n\nA promotional album issued by Warner Brothers in 1979, this features an exclusive \ninterview by Dave Herman with Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Graham Chapman, with \nside two adding extracts from a second interview with Eric Idle and George \nHarrison.\n\n32 FAREWELL TO JOHN DENVER\n\n33 I'M SO WORRIED (FLUFFED MID-SECTION)\n\n34 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION CASSETTE EXTRAS\n\nThree links from first-run cassette editions of the album. The first two, by \nMichael Palin and Terry Jones, closed side one of the original British cassette \nreleases (originally framed by substantially long dead-air pauses), and the third, \nby Eric Idle, was exclusive to the American edition. Restored as best as possible \n(which isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t saying much) from a very hissy tape, but a fascinating curiosity.\n\n35 THE SERMON\n\nRecorded and released in 1987 as part of MotoÃŒË†rhead's Rock 'n' Roll LP, this brief \nitem was improvised by Michael Palin and recorded by Python album producer AndreÃŒï¿½ \nJacquemin at his Redwood Studios. Restored from CD.\n\n36-38 FINAL RIP OFF REMIXES\n\nUnavailable anywhere else, the effects-heavy remixes of Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Like ChineseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“FinlandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Bet You They Won't Play This Song On The RadioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ released on the \n1987 Final Rip Off compilation. Listen out for the extra varispeeded voices in the \nfirst song and the crucially mistimed sound effects in the last.\n\n39 FINAL RIP OFF LINKS\n\nA tasteful montage of Michael Palin's five exclusive links from the same \ncompilation. Restored from CD.\n\n40 ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE (1991 RADIO EDIT)\n\n41 ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE (1991 RE-RECORDING)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6688fe5aee11759bd60df0ef9e4293e55a5f428","amp;dn":"Monty+Python+Slipped+Discs+%282+CD+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6688fe5aee11759bd60df0ef9e4293e55a5f428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,104,143,229,174,225,23,89,189,96,223,14,249,228,41,62,85,165,244,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
