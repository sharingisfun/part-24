It's a record that I nearly classify as &quot;Easy Listening&quot;. It's a perfect background sound for cooking and cleaning.No wonder my mother likes it so much. I remember that we listened also often to it while playing Blackjack. So biggie up and respect to my mother and the allmighty Jah who created her and these  Antonio Carlos and Jocafi  guys. Enjoy!  Have also a look on other torrents I've posted and feel free to place a comment or a feedback. I would be very glad about. Eskerrik asko ! Thank you!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAupa Athletik!
