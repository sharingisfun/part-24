The message reveals the account of a sixteenth-century explorer who claims to have found a passageway to the centre of the earth. In his quest to penetrate the planetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s primordial secrets, the impetuous professor, together with his quaking nephew, Axel, and their devoted guide, Hans, sets off immediately for Iceland. Descending through the belly of a volcano into the bowels of the Earth, they discover an astonishing subterranean world of prehistoric proportions.\n\nA classic of science fiction that helped give birth to the genre, this imaginative speculation on the earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nature is both a rousing adventure story and an apt portrait of the psychology of the questing scientist.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ac3f0660cdc90704e36f6ce2e7578b8169e00aa","amp;dn":"Journey+to+the+Centre+of+the+Earth+-+Jules+Verne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ac3f0660cdc90704e36f6ce2e7578b8169e00aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,195,240,102,12,220,144,112,78,54,246,206,46,117,120,184,22,158,0,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
