Peter is joined by the cast of the \nmusical Loserville and is helped in his exploration of the 118 modern elements \nby a periodic table made from audience members at the Royal Institution.\n\n\n\nMedieval alchemists wrote of a mysterious fountain of youth, whose waters could \nrejuvenate anyone who drank them. But can water really be magical? \n\nIn the second of this year's Christmas Lectures, Dr Peter Wothers drinks from \nthe fountain and finds out whether the elements lurking in the water can \nrestore his youth. Along the way he discovers how exploding balloons could \nsolve the energy crisis, how water contains the remains of the most violent \nreactions on Earth and that the real secret to eternal youth might be drinking \nno water at all. \n\nPeter is joined in his quest by Paralympic champion cyclist Mark Colbourne and \nfinds out what happens when the two most reactive elements on the periodic \ntable, caesium and fluorine, meet each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: BBC Royal Institution Christmas Lectures The Modern Alchemist 3 of 3 \n       The Philosopher's Stone 2012\n \nFor centuries alchemists have tried to turn base metals into gold. But is such \na feat even possible? \n\nIn the final Christmas Lecture, Dr Peter Wothers explores the elements within \nthe earth and discovers just how difficult it is for chemists to extract the \nplanet's greatest treasures. He discovers how our knowledge of the elements can \nallow us to levitate, turn carbon dioxide into diamonds and maybe turn lead \ninto gold. \n\nPeter is joined by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Professor Sir Harry Kroto and \ntogether they find out whether a member of the audience is really worth their \nweight in gold and what happens when you set fire to a diamond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=-== HELP TO SEED this great Documentary and Learning programme","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf3af2ceb2160c87080c4f8a0d376e9f67c1c9d3","amp;dn":"BBC+Royal+Institution+Christmas+Lectures+2012+The+Modern+Alchemi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf3af2ceb2160c87080c4f8a0d376e9f67c1c9d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,58,242,206,178,22,12,135,8,12,79,138,13,55,110,159,103,193,201,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
