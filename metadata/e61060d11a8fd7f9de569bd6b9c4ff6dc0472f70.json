She was wrong. Now she finds herself in the service of Duke Sylvester Torquill, sharing an apartment with her Fetch, and maintaining an odd truce with Tybalt, the local King of Cats. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a delicate balance - one thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shattered when she learns that an old friend is in dire trouble. Lily, Lady of the Tea Gardens, has been struck down by a mysterious, seemingly impossible illness, leaving her fiefdom undefended.\n\nStruggling to find a way to save Lily and her subjects, Toby must confront her own past as an enemy she thought was gone forever raises her head once more: Oleander de Merelands, one of the two people responsible for her fourteen-year exile. But if OleanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s back, whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s her game? Where is she hiding? And what part does TobyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother, Amandine, have to play?\n\nTime is growing short and the stakes are getting higher. For the Queen of the Mists has her own agenda, and there are more players in this game than Toby can guess. With everything on the line, she will have to take the ultimate risk to save herself and the people she loves most - because if she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find the missing pieces of the puzzle in time, Toby will be forced to make the one choice she never thought sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have to face again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e61060d11a8fd7f9de569bd6b9c4ff6dc0472f70","amp;dn":"+Late+Eclipses+-+Seanan+McGuire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e61060d11a8fd7f9de569bd6b9c4ff6dc0472f70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,16,96,209,26,143,215,249,222,86,155,214,185,196,255,109,192,71,47,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
