And his 68 string quartets? They are the standard by which all other Classical string quartets were and are judged. No less an expert than Mozart wrote that it was from Haydn that he had learned how to write quartets.\n\nAnd yet this gentle, creative dynamo, who penned more than 1,000 works over a 50-year career and remained musically vital well past middle age, is all too often thought of as an aged figure surpassed and overshadowed by Mozart and Beethoven. \n\n\n8 Lectures\n45 minutes / lecture\n\n1    Introduction and Early Life \n2    The Lean Years and the Pre-Classical Style \n3    Haydn's Marriage and EsterhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡za \n4    EsterhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡za Continued \n5    The Classical String Quartet and the Classical Symphony \n6    London \n7    Beethoven, London Again, and Breakthrough \n8    The Creation, The Seasons, and the End ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5045cad281dcdfa128988d2f5e9ccfe4ee08eb67","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Great+Masters+-+Haydn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5045cad281dcdfa128988d2f5e9ccfe4ee08eb67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,69,202,210,129,220,223,161,40,152,141,47,94,156,207,228,238,8,235,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
