It was first published as a serialization in &quot;Le Gaulois&quot; from September 23, 1909 to January 8, 1910. Initially, the story sold very poorly upon publication in book form and was even out of print several times during the twentieth century, despite the success of its various film and stage adaptations.[citation needed] The most notable of these were the 1925 film depiction and Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 musical. The Phantom of the Opera musical is now the longest running Broadway show in history, and one of the most lucrative entertainment enterprises of all time.\n\nPlot\n\nThe novel opens with a controversial prologue in which Gaston Leroux claims that Erik was a real person.\n\nChristine DaaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s mother died when she was very young. She and her father, a famous violinist, travelled all over Sweden playing folk and religious music. Her father was known to be the best wedding fiddler in the land. During Christine's childhood, her father told her many stories. A character known as the Angel of Music figured heavily in them, especially one about a girl he called Little Lotte, who was able to hear the Angel of Music. When Christine meets and befriends Raoul, he also enjoys her father's many Stories.\n\nLater, when Father DaaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is passing away - probably of tuberculosis - he tells Christine that when he dies he will send the Angel of Music(the phantom) to her. Christine grieves for her father endlessly. She lives with an elderly woman whose now deceased husband had been her father's benefactor.\n\nChristine is eventually given a position in the chorus at the Paris Opera House. Not long after she arrives there, she begins hearing a voice which sings to her and speaks to her. She believes this must be the Angel of Music and asks him if he is. The Voice agrees and offers to teach her &quot;a little bit of heaven's music.&quot; The Voice, however, belongs to Erik, a disfigured genius who was on the construction crew when the Opera was built and who secretly built into the cellars a home for himself. He is the Opera ghost (&quot;FantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´me&quot; in French can be translated as both &quot;ghost&quot; and &quot;phantom&quot;) who has been extorting money from the Opera's management for many years. Unknown to Christine, at least at first, he has fallen in love with her.\n\nWith the help of the Voice, Christine triumphs at the gala on the night of the old managers' retirement. Her old childhood friend Raoul hears her and remembers his love for her. After the gala, Erik takes Christine to live in his home in the cellars, but after two weeks, when Christine requests release, he agrees, on condition that she wear his ring and be faithful to him.\n\nUp on the roof of the Opera, Christine tells Raoul of Erik taking her to the cellars. Raoul promises to take Christine away where Erik can never find her. Raoul tells Christine he shall act on his promise the following day, to which Christine agrees, but she pities Erik and will not go until she has sung for him one last time. The two leave, unaware that Erik was listening to their conversation. During the week and that night however, Erik has been terrorizing anyone who stood in his way, or in the way of Christine's career, including the managers.\n\nThe following night, Erik kidnaps Christine during a production of Faust. Back in the cellars, Erik tries to force Christine into marrying him. If she refuses he will destroy the entire Opera using explosives planted in the cellars, killing everyone in it including himself and Christine. Christine continues to refuse, until she realizes that Raoul and a man known only as 'The Persian', in an attempt to rescue her, have been trapped in Erik's torture chamber. To save them and the people above, Christine agrees to marry Erik and kisses him. Erik, who admits that he has never before in his life received a kiss - not even from his own mother - is overcome with emotion. He lets Christine go and tells her &quot;go and marry the boy whenever you wish&quot;, explaining that &quot;I know you love him.&quot; They cry together, and then she leaves. Three weeks later, a notice appears in a Paris newspaper stating that Erik is dead.\n[edit] Characters\n\n    * Erik ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The &quot;Phantom&quot;, a deformed man (believed to be a ghost)\n    * Christine DaaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ A young, Swedish soprano.\n    * Raoul, Viscount de Chagny ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Christine's childhood friend and love interest.\n    * The Persian ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ A mysterious man from Erik's past.\n    * Count Philippe de Chagny ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Raoul's elder brother.\n    * Moncharmin and Richard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The managers of the opera house.\n    * Madame Giry - The suspicious caretaker for Box Five\n    * Meg Giry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Madame Giry's only daughter, a ballet girl.\n    * Carlotta ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The spoiled prima donna.\n    * Joseph Buquet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The chief scene-shifter.\n    * Debienne and Poligny ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The previous managers of the opera house.\n    * La Sorelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The lead ballet dancer.\n    * Little Jammes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ A friend of Meg and also a ballet girl.\n    * RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©my ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The manager's secretary.\n    * Mercier ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The acting-manager.\n    * Gabriel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The superstitious chorus-master.\n    * Mme. la Baronne de Castelot-Barbezac ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Meg as an adult.\n    * Mifroid ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The commissary of police called in for Christine's disappearance.\n-Wiki","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3add9ebdf98ce4d5706f32518592080077a6d3fe","amp;dn":"The+Phantom+Of+The+Opera+-+Gaston+Leroux+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3add9ebdf98ce4d5706f32518592080077a6d3fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,221,158,189,249,140,228,213,112,111,50,81,133,146,8,0,119,166,211,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
