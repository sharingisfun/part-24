Director Lipsky threw singing cowboy films, Dudley Doright, and Marx (Karl, that is) in a blender, hit pulp, and poured out a delicious candy-colored malt that is far from perfect, but certainly a sight to see. This is definitely one for the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI have never seen anything quite like that beforeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ category.\n\nKarel Fiala stars as the titular hero, Kolaloka lemonade advocate and the straight-shootinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢est cowboy around. The action is set in a fictional Arizona, where Doug Badman, owner of the Trigger Whisky saloon, controls a small town, and entertains himself by sponsoring saloon girl musical numbers and what may be the longest craziest bar brawl of all time. When BadmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s glass-eating thug menaces temperance crusader Ezra Goodman, and his luscious daughter Winnifred, Lemonade Joe shows up to save the day in his own inimitable style. JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s arrival sets off a moderately vicious battle for the minds (and wallets) of the townÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s residents between GoodmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s newly founded Kolaloka outlet, and BadmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s depraved whisky den. Events are complicated by the arrival of Doug BadmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even worse brother Horace Badman, and by Tornado Lou, the local torch singer, who has been waiting for a champion like Joe and does not want competition from the demure Winnifred.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Lemonade Joe.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,462,972,416 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:35:22\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 688x280 (AR: 2.457)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1811 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.376 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 224 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058275/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058275/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCzech audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subpack\n\nMy rip of the Czech Filmexport DVD.
