His paranoia, little annoyances, big annoyances, chase of rainbows, love of comics, travel impressions from around the world, dealing with kids, being a kid: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about life as we know it. A collection from his comics blog that expands his palette with full color painting, one can only be awed at TrondheimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncanny sense of observation and relate to all his experiences closely. Another touch of genius by one of today's best and most influential comic artists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b5a4588c2fa63020d0321d5eeca60802be9bf6d","amp;dn":"Lewis+Trondheim+-+Little+Nothings+The+Curse+of+the+Umbrella","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b5a4588c2fa63020d0321d5eeca60802be9bf6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,90,69,136,194,250,99,2,13,3,33,213,238,202,96,128,43,233,191,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
