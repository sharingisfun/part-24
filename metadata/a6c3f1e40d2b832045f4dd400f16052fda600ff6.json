Her writing acts as a creative counterpoint to her straightlaced corporate existence. She lives in Ohio with two cats and her husband who both inspires her fantasies and supports her careers. When she can escape her office, she loves to travel the world, avoid speeding tickets in her beloved Sky and, of course, read.\n\n\n1. Night is Darkest: Some secrets refuse to stay hidden.\n\nLacey DaughtryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfect weekend is interrupted by tragic news of her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder in the line of duty. Plagued by a rash of mysterious phone calls, she turns to her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friends and fellow officers for protectionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and comfort. \nSpending time in close contact with Mason and Tyler, the two men sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreamed of since her first girlhood crush, seems like the answer to a prayer. Especially when they begin to explore the desire sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harbored for so long. \nBut the partners are holding out on Lacey. Determined to suppress the most extreme facets of their lust, they agree to settle for sharing the woman they crave while concealing their desire for each other. Until Lacey cracks their resolve, unleashing a torrent of emotions that threatens to distract them when they can least afford it. \nTheir blossoming relationship is complicated by secrets. And the only way to evade the killer threatening their lives is to bare their souls in the darkest hours of the night. Or everything will come crashing down, just before the dawn.\n\n2. RazorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Edge: ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a thin line between protection and betrayalÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re dancing on it.\nIsabellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marriage to the wealthiest man in the state looked fairytale perfect. Only she knows the truth behind the nightmare forcing her to run with the clothes on her back, the scars on her body and no one to trust. Not even her own father. \nWhen the man hunting her has unlimited resources, hiding in plain sight is a wise choice. Isabella basks in the protection of the limelight as an instructor on a pro-am TV dance competition. Perfect plan, except her ornery partner is packing moves she never learned in any studio.\nA rookie mistake in the line of duty earned Razor months of rehab and a healthy distrust of innocent-looking women. Determined to prove to his fellow men in blue his green has worn off, he goes undercover as IsabellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dance partner to investigate her possible involvement in a sex-slavery ring. But as he attempts to cozy up for information, their instant chemistry challenges his detached composure. \nAn attempt on her life should have cleared the air. Instead it muddies the waters even more, forcing them both to trust each other. And depend on the one thing Razor \nthought heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d lost. His instinct.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6c3f1e40d2b832045f4dd400f16052fda600ff6","amp;dn":"Men+in+Blue+series+-+Jayne+Rylon%2C%28books+1-2%29Epub%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6c3f1e40d2b832045f4dd400f16052fda600ff6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,195,241,228,13,43,131,32,69,244,221,64,15,22,5,47,218,96,15,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
