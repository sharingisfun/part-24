Real estate and renovation experts, Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott, come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of an extreme fixer-upper. A tough decision between two renovation projects has to be made but the couple finally pulls the trigger. Now the brothers only have five weeks to completely transform the house as promised. Tensions arise when the couple can't agree on design details, threatening the team's finishing date. To get everything done on time and on budget, the brothers have to sprint for the finish.\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b77b319a232ebf7a76ce0976230ca97bd3b0af4f","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e04.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b77b319a232ebf7a76ce0976230ca97bd3b0af4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,123,49,154,35,46,191,122,118,206,9,118,35,12,169,123,211,176,175,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
