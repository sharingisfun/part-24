Upgrade and no-CD patcher included in first ISO. Does NOT include Mercenary expansion pack.\n\n\nGame info: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_3&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nA very under-appreciated title and very advanced for its time. If you like it you can pick up a real copy (WITH the mercenary expansion pack!) for like $5 online.\n\n\nFrom Instructions.txt:\n----------------------\n1) Mount or burn ISO for disc 1 (Burn Disc 2 also, if you&amp;#039;re doing that...)\n\n2) Install (Do a &quot;full&quot; install if you aren&amp;#039;t burning the discs). Remount/swap discs if the setup asks. DO NOT install into a &quot;deep&quot; directory. Ideally it should be installed fairly close to the drive root (c:descent3). The game apparently has issues with long path names and will crash.\n\n3) Apply Update on Disc 1 (update/ folder - copy the EXE to game&amp;#039;s directory first!)\n\n4) Apply NoCD crack on disc 1 (nocd/ folder - copy the EXE to game&amp;#039;s directory first!)\n\n5) Launch from a command prompt as:\n\n&gt; main.exe -launched  United States\n\n...and bypass the stupid registration nag and setup/launcher utility or just use the included play.bat file.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22cc38f27955930da60a95d9ea6c23a647f42bc","amp;dn":"Descent+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22cc38f27955930da60a95d9ea6c23a647f42bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,44,195,143,39,149,89,48,218,96,169,93,158,166,194,58,100,127,66,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
