As with other apps, you can choose exactly how much of the screen you'll shoot. Snagit's edge is that it now combines the most oft-selected capture profiles into one, so that reaching for the Print Screen keyboard shortcut gives you a mega-tool for capturing either the whole screen, a window, a region, or a scrolling area, with just some considered cursor placement and a single click. We have to admit that the new default capture profile may confuse at first, but those who find it too much of a visual riot can always swap in a different default.\n\nIn addition to snagging images, Snagit has separate capture settings for copying Web sites, text, and even video; you can record your screen's action in the AVI format. This version of Snagit improves on the text capture tool, retaining the style formatting in Snagit's editor and adding some editing tools so you can further manipulate the text.\n\nAs with the previous version, which overhauled Snagit's user-friendly editor, Snagit 10's image editor stores screenshots in an icon library that's accessible from the main pane, making it a breeze to revisit past shots, even if you've never saved them to your drive.\n\nThe search bar is also a lifesaver for finding the automatically-indexed screenshots of yore. Though Snagit's editing tools aren't as professional as some other high-end editors, it does provide a satisfying array of tools to annotate, resize, recolor, and otherwise manipulate images with hyperlinked hot spots, tags, and visual effects, like the newly introduced page-curl effect. We think a few of the stamps, art, and tools could be more versatile, but we were able to do most of what we set out to accomplish on a daily basis with speed, ease, and consistent results. \n\n\nYou'll love using Snagit, in a million different ways. Screen capture lets you show, instead of just tell.\nThe ultimate do-it-yourself screen capture tool is better than ever. Snagit 10 provides a smarter and more efficient way to grab your images, with updated capture profiles and effects to improve how you capture, edit, share and organize your content.\n\nAll-in-One Capture:\n====================\nSnag anything, on the fly. Use the newest capture profile to grab your entire desktop, a region, a window, or a scrolling windowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all with a single hotkey or click.\n\nUpdated Transparency:\n======================\nNow you can keep the rounded corners from a captured windowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ or create a custom shape... and the only background youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see is the one on your website, document, or slide. \n\nUpload to Screencast.com:\n==========================\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easier than ever to send your captures out for review with built-in, online hosting from Screencast.com. Now you can share your images with an embed code or give them a URL with a clickable thumbnail. Store, share and gather feedback on all of your visual projects. \n\n\nImproved Auto-Scroll:\n======================\nSnagitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s auto-scroll feature has drastically improved and can now sense when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re on a web page that scrolls. Snagit will automatically move through the pageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ capturing it both vertically and horizontallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ at your command. Just point and click.\n\nUpdated Magnifier:\n===================\nLike a microscope for your computer screenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ use magnified cross hairs to get exact, down-to-the-pixel precision on every capture.\n\nFormatted Text Capture:\n========================\nPerfect for reviewing text and making changesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½grab the text straight off a web page and keep the formattingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½then edit and apply different font styles, sizes and colors.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nTested And Working...\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n\n(If You Found Something &quot;Un-Clean&quot; In Any Of My Torrents, Consider That It May Be A False Positive(Alert) And If you Are Sure Please Report It To Me So I Would Remove It)\n\n[Please Leave A Comment Confirming This Pack]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f69bcb558fb5550789e92128e74c15be090f8dd1","amp;dn":"SnagIt+v10.0.0+%2B+Serials+%5BChattChitto+RG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f69bcb558fb5550789e92128e74c15be090f8dd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,155,203,85,143,181,85,7,137,233,33,40,231,76,21,190,9,15,141,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
