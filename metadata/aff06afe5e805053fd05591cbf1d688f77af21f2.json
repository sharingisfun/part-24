To top it off, he's affected by blackouts which put him at risk in the air, but he flies anyway. Brad comes under further pressure when his girlfriend turns up pregnant, and more so when he comes to the rescue of his protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©, pitting himself and a T-tail Piper Lance against a P-51 Mustang flown by a smuggler in a rather spectacular aerial scene. By the time the dust settles, Brad is ready to compete in an airshow and comes to grips with his worries and his life when he's spared in a plane accident and he meets his new child. Of course, at the end, everything's gonna be alright.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aff06afe5e805053fd05591cbf1d688f77af21f2","amp;dn":"Cloud+Dancer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aff06afe5e805053fd05591cbf1d688f77af21f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,240,106,254,94,128,80,83,253,5,89,28,191,29,104,143,119,175,33,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
