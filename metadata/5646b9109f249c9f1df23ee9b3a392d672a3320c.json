The\ncrate of records he had been cradling in his nubile appendages now lay in pieces\non the ashen ground, his complete collected recordings of sixties psychedelic\nluminary Rick &quot;Paisley Dave&quot; Rigmore scattered hit her and yon like so many dead\nleaves beneath a diseased elm. Noting his neglect to accredit this phrase to its\nrightful owner, chief engineer Jenny Conlee, her accordion neatly strapped to\nher back, stepped lightly from the caboose and corrected his negligence with the\naplomb only an immigrant Hungarian could muster: &quot;Dylan Thomas, sir! Please move\nalong!&quot; But it was too late: an indelible bond had been soldered in that moment\nof recognition. A few hours later, in a Turkish bath, they revealed their\nstories to one another between sips of a strange, tangerine liqueur. Not far\nfrom that spot, however, two young military dignitaries (John Moen, Nate Query),\nappropriately lathered, overheard our two heroes&amp;#039; stories. Was it chance, then,\nthat lead the four unsuspecting bathers to seek to return their soiled\nundergarments at the same kiosk where worked the poor, bespectacled Colin Meloy?\nOne can surmise all one wants, but the truth should be known that, after\nadopting the moniker The Decemberists, these five wan vagabonds began playing\ntheir peculiarly styled pop music in various concert-halls and brothels all\nacross the globe.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5646b9109f249c9f1df23ee9b3a392d672a3320c","amp;dn":"The_Decemberists-The_Crane_Wife-2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5646b9109f249c9f1df23ee9b3a392d672a3320c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,70,185,16,159,36,156,159,29,242,62,233,179,163,146,214,114,163,50,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
