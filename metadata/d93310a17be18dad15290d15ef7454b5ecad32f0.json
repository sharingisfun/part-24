The Life and Death of Peter Sellers is the story of the comic actor, who would later immortalize bumbling Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther series. From his beginnings in show business as a variety performer to his ultimate success as a movie star, Peter Sellers was a man of many faces. But it was also that moniker that caught up with his personal life, when Sellers was a man without an identity and only a library of oddball characters to make up for his personality. Focusing on his rising success and his family life, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers is the story of a man whose personal life clashed with stardom, while he was an individual completely immersed in the characters he portrayed.\n\n\nDirector: Stephen Hopkins\nWriters (WGA): Roger Lewis (book), Christopher Markus (teleplay)\nRelease Date: 2004\nGenre: Biography | Drama\n\n\nAwards:\nWon 2 Golden Globes.
