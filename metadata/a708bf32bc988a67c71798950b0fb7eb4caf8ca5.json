However, unlike their New York peers, they celebrated only cult success and broke up after releasing two full-lengths, one of which was only available in a private print. Spanish label Xtreem Music repressed the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full-length Ritual Of Infinity along with their first 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ EP, Adipocere, on one CD in 2005, the first MD material to achieve widespread distribution.\n\nAlthough they would forever lurk in the shadows of more successful brethren such as Suffocation, Immolation, and Incantation, Middletown, NY's Morpheus Descends (initially named simply Morpheus) were also minor contributors to establishing the Empire State's peculiarly dense and Byzantine brand of '90s death metal (as compared to the dominant Floridian strain).\n\nAt the very beginning, in late 1990, though, Morpheus Descends' guitarist Rob Yench, vocalist Jeff Reimer, bassist Ken Faggio, and drummer Sam Inzerra had world-conquering plans of their own, so they hastily (and, in retrospect, regrettably) partnered with independent JL Records to assemble their 1992 debut album, Ritual of Infinity, from a series of demo sessions undertaken over the previous two years. Not surprisingly, the band soon found their label sorely lacking in promotional support and endeavored to release 1994's Chronicles of the Shadowed Ones EP (featuring second guitarist Bryan Johnston and new bass player Andy Newton) themselves; a move that at least allowed them to pocket most of the cash from what copies were sold during their extensive ensuing tours with Incantation, Anal Cunt, Absu, and Enslaved.\n\nBut aside from growing respect within the underground death metal scene, Morpheus Descends returned home with precious little to show for all of their hard work, and had fallen hopelessly behind their onetime peers (Suffocation, in particular) by this time. So, after replacing Reimer and Johnston with vocalist/guitarist Tom Stevens (ex-Nokturne, Ripping Corpse, etc.), the group recorded 1997's The Horror of the Truth EP in a last ditch effort to turn their fortunes around -- alas, all to no avail.\n\nBy the following year, Stevens and Yench had begun moonlighting with the aforementioned Incantation and bassist Newton had created the pseudonym of Lord Typhus Mirinor and launched the black metal band Fog. Drummer Inzerra also resurfaced eventually, in a crossover side project named Generation Kill, featuring Pro-Pain's Rob Moschetti and Exodus' Rob Dukes, but original Morpheus Descends vocalist Jeff Reimer was less fortunate, passing away from a reported heroin overdose in August of 2005.\n\n\nMorpheus Descends On Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n1992 Ritual Of Infinity\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.

ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s raw, loud, and fast which is what death metal should be. With the release of Ritual of Infinity, Morpheus Descends made sure that they would be remembered as one of the leaders of northeastern death metal and one of the greatest death metal acts to come out of the United States period.\n\nThe production on this CD isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t great, but then again very few death metal bands actually do have topnotch production anyways so this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a big deal. The unrefined and unpolished feel of this CD almost helps the listener to really get a feel for Ritual of Infinity though, so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t not buy this CD just because it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound crisp and clean. Some of the better tracks are Accelerated Decrepitude, Immortal Coil, and the title track, Ritual of Infinity. Each song brings something new to this CD in their brutality, speed, and intensity, but then again, the whole CD is just one big mess of hard as shit death metal. I highly recommend checking out Morpheus Descends if you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already, your eardrums will thank you for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenre:\tDeath\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t75.08 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n9 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a708bf32bc988a67c71798950b0fb7eb4caf8ca5","amp;dn":"+Morpheus+Descends+-+Ritual+Of+Infinity+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a708bf32bc988a67c71798950b0fb7eb4caf8ca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,8,191,50,188,152,138,103,199,23,152,149,11,15,183,235,76,175,140,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
