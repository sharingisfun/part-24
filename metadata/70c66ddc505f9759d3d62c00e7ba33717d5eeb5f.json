Makes a perfect gift, too!\nHand-crafted items always add an extra layer of personality and interest to a room, and a beautifully designed and knitted piece, whether it is a cover for an existing piece of furniture or a wonderful throw, is a covetable and unique accessory. If you enjoy exploring the different patterns and textures that hand knitting can create, and want to use these skills to produce elegant and appealing pieces for your home, The Knitted Home is for you.\nRuth Cross draws on her experience of designing organic and freeform collections to guide you through the process of making and creating your own items. Taking an experimental approach, Ruth combines traditional stitches with new stitches she has devised herself. She creates desirable fabrics that can adorn many different items around the home, from easy chairs to footstools, a doorstop to a table runner, vase covers to wall hangings.\n\nAbout the Author\nRuth Bridgeman started her handknits company, Ruth Cross, in 2004, which quickly became known for its innovative design. The Ruth Cross audience has never been wider, but the goal has always remained the same: to develop knitting as a fresh and exciting contemporary craft.
