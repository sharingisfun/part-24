As a result of its airing on WABC-TV, the manner of treating people with disabilities was forever changed.\n\nAs the producers were putting the documentary together, they located a piece of film shot 10 years earlier of Robert F. Kennedy after he completed a tour of Willowbrook. He said, &quot;Willowbrook was a disgrace.&quot; Despite Kennedy's anger and compassion, nothing was done about it.\n\nGeraldo Rivera, the film's correspondent, is quoted, &quot;I can show you what it looked like and what it sounded like, but I can never show you how it smelled and the horrible conditions.&quot;\n\nThe film won the 1972 Peabody Award.\n\nAlbert T.
