Since Kevin has the ability to open the suit using his Osmosian powers to absorb Taedenite, \nP'andor tricks him into cutting it open. Free from his containment, P'andor begins feeding on all the energy he can find,\n making his way to a nuclear power plant.

Nemesis decides to hold a friendly test of skill between them, and Ben again comes out on top.\n Finally pushed to the edge, he captures Julie and Jennifer, daring Ben to try and save them.\n Ben rescues Julie while leaving Jennifer to Kevin and Gwen, then defeats Nemesis (now calling himself Overlord).

Azmuth tells Ben that Aggregor intends to steal the Map of Infinity, \na complete map of the entire universe. With it, he'll be able to find the Forge of Creation, the birthplace of the universe.\n He further explains that Aggregor stole the five aliens' powers to protect him from the traps guarding the map, \nwhich was split into four pieces by Professor Paradox. In order to keep him from assembling the map, the team tries to \ntake the first piece of the Map of Infinity first, which is at Mykdl'dy (Big Chill's home planet).\n After a battle with the Necrofriggian guards, they go through the temple that houses the piece, getting past the traps, \nbut are unable to retrieve the piece after Ben (as Fourarms) and Kevin are holding a door up, and Gwen is knocked out by a poison spike.\n Aggregor appears and thanks them for disabling the traps for him, and in a boost of anger, \nBen holds the door himself, allowing them to escape.  \n\n12 \t&quot;Reflected Glory&quot;\t\t Matt Youngberg \t Peter David \t\t October 15, 2010 (2010-10-15)\t  112 \n---\t-----------------\t\t----------------\t--------------\t\t------------------------------\t  ----\nCash and JT start a TV show with Oliver (who was fired by Will Harangue after what happened in Video Games) as their cameraman, \nin which they claim to be the brains behind Ben's success as a hero.

Unfortunately for the duo, their act of heroism goes unnoticed, \nthe weapon having knocked out the camera before firing, and their earlier confession has alienated their fanbase.\n Oliver leaves telling the boys that the show is over.  \n\n13\t &quot;Deep&quot;\t\t\t\t Dan Riba \t\tMarty Isenberg\t\t October 22, 2010 (2010-10-22)\t   113 \n---\t--------\t\t\t----------\t\t---------------\t\t------------------------------\t  ----\nBen, Gwen, and Kevin travel to the water planet Pisces (Ripjaws' home planet) after learning that Aggregor is on the planet.\n Aided by Magister Pyke, they travel to the planet's core, which contains a gravitational multiplier holding the water planet together.\n Aggregor steals the device, which is actually a disguised piece of the Map of Infinity, and escapes, \ncausing the inhabitants to turn on Ben, Gwen and Kevin.

When this fails, \nParadox arrives and changes Alien X back to Ben. After a brief argument, Paradox and Azmuth explain that the Forge of\n Creation is where all Celestialsapiens (Alien X's race) are born, and Aggregor hopes to absorb the \npowers and abilities of a newborn Celestialsapien and become omnipotent. Paradox takes them to the Forge of Creation, \nwhere an accident pulls Ben's ten-year-old self out of the timestream.

As they make their way through the Forge, they discover many Celestialsapiens in debate with themselves, \n\nand eventually a Celestialsapien egg.\n Aggregor reaches the egg at the same time the group does and takes everyone out with ease. \nIn a last-ditch effort, Kevin absorbs energy from present-Ben's Ultimatrix, but the process drives him insane.\n He is now mutated like his old self, but has the new aliens instead of the old ones, becoming Ultimate Kevin.\n Kevin easily defeats Aggregor before absorbing his stolen power and attempting to kill him, \nonly to be met with opposition from Gwen and both Bens. Past-Ben manages to get through to Kevin, \nwho spares Aggregor's life before flying away, claiming he will not be so merciful tomorrow.\n Paradox arrives at that moment to take them home before the other Celestialsapiens wake up, \nsince he is not supposed to be near them, and return past-Ben to his own time period.\n Paradox claims that past-Ben will dismiss the entire experience as a dream while present-day Ben resolves to stop Kevin.  \n\n17\t &quot;...Nor Iron Bars a Cage&quot;\t Dan Riba\t\t Len Wein\t\t November 19, 2010 (2010-11-19)\t    117 \n---\t---------------------------\t----------\t\t----------\t\t-------------------------------\t    ---\nWith Kevin having absorbed the Ultimatrix's aliens and gone back to his insane state, he returns back to the Null Void prison, \nIncarcecon.

There are also flashbacks that Kevin has, how he left his first mutation and started to absorb solid matter \nboth with the help of a fellow inmate named Kwarrel, and showed how he escaped from the prison, \nwith Kwarrel sacrificing himself to Morgg in the process. Ben and Gwen soon realize that Morgg is forcing the prisoners to \nmine a blue substance which is sold as a hallucenagenic drug. Kevin manages to catch up with Morgg to exact his revenge, \ndropping him in an elevator and cutting the line.

Ben battles Kevin but cannot defeat him.\n Rhomboid then launches a nuclear bomb, which will destroy the Academy and everyone in it, \nbut Ben uses Ultimate Echo-Echo to destroy the bomb.

He then starts looking for Kevin, \nattacking anyone who has ever had any criminal connections with him, including the Forever Knights and Vulkanus.\n Gwen, looking for an alternative, tracks down Darkstar. She convinces Darkstar to help Kevin, and in return,\n she gives him enough mana to retain his normal appearance for one year. Together with a newly matured Cooper, \nDarkstar devises a plan to save Kevin using a fragment of the Dominus Librium.

The first bit of the plan is a success, but Cooper and Darkstar need more time to finish the machine, \nso Ben recruits his remaining allies, Grandpa Max, Julie, and Ship, to help hold him off. \nAfter a long standoff, Ben is able to use Ultimate Echo Echo to finally subdue Kevin and hook him into the completed machine.\n The machine restores an exhausted Kevin to normal. Suddenly, Darkstar uses the machine to drain the powers and abilities from Kevin into himself, \nglowing with god-like power. Predicting this outcome in advance, Ben hits a kill switch on the machine that takes all the stolen powers from Darkstar, \nand gives them back to their rightful owners, in the process of returning Bivalvan, Galapagus, P'andor, Andreas, and Ra'ad to life.\n Ra'ad thanks them.
