This is probaly one of the last ever NOFX shows in a small venue. Fat Mike has his leg in plaster and the crowd is insane, El Hefe tries to speak scottish and they even do S &amp;amp; M Airlines. This is one show everyone must get, its filmed in my usual high stadard and i guarantee the drunken madness will have you laughing out loud. I hope you enjoy this half as much as the crowd does!\n\nNOFX-The Venue Edinburgh Scotland 28th June 1994 SVCD 80m Minutes\n\nTrack List:-\n01-Please Play This Song On The Radio\n02-Moron Brothers\n03-Punk Guy\n04-Life Of Riley\n05-Stickin' In My Eye\n06-The Brews\n07-Together On The Sand\n08-Nowhere\n09-A Perfect Government\n10-Bob\n11-Showerdays\n12-Straightedge\n13-Liza &amp;amp; Louize\n14-Quass\n15-Dying Degree\n16-Kill All The White Man\n17-Drinking &amp;amp; Driving\n18-Don't Call Me White\n19-Malachi Crunch\n20-Johnny Appleseed\n21-She's Gone\n22-Buggley Eyes\n23-Linoleum\n24-S &amp;amp; M Airlines\n\nThese are in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to 2xCD's and they will play in most DVD players.
