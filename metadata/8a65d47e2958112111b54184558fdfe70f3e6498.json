Such a manifest fancy, within the realm of probability, is RKO's &quot;Joan of Paris,&quot; which came to the Rivoli on Saturday. For here is a tale of personal valor and selfless sacrifice which is told so simply and eloquently, and is so beautifully played that it might be a true re-enactment of a gallant episode. At least, it cheers the heart and stirs the pulse to think that it might be.\n\nInspired by a burning legend and their respect for the spirit of France, the authors are telling a story of a modern namesake of St. JoanÃ¢â‚¬â€a little Parisian barmaid who emulates her patron saint in her small way by aiding a fugitive British airman and four companions to escape from France. During the dangerous manoeuvres to get the fliers out of ParisÃ¢â‚¬â€manoeuvres in which a French priest and a British agent participateÃ¢â‚¬â€Joan falls in love with the leader of the squadron, a Free French ace. And the measure of her courage and devotion is proved by the inevitable fact that she must pay with her life that her lover and his companions may escape.\n\nAround this simple story the authors and Director Robert Stevenson have shaped a film which is taut with fearful uncertainties and packed with sincere compassion. From the moment that the five elusive fliers make their appointed rendezvous in a tenebrous Paris church, there to seek contact with a British agent, they become the desperate quarry of the unrelenting Nazi Gestapo. To the rolling strains of solemn ecclesiastical music the leader is spotted by a squat, evil visaged secret agent, who follows him tenaciously and continues terrifyingly on his heels until a final, climactic showdown.\n\nWith truly masterful employment of the camera and sharp cutting, Director Stevenson has made this chase a brilliantly suspenseful thing. His frequent use of close-ups and shots of feet pounding along pavements have neatly coordinated subjective reactions with objective pace. And the tension of martial law upon a credible Parisian population has been most effectively suggested in a few brief but comprehensive glimpses.\n\nMr. Stevenson's accomplishments with his actors have been no less excellent. Michele Morgan, the talented French actress who is especially remembered for her performanc in &quot;Le Quai des Brumes,&quot; gives deep poignance and real nobility to the character of the dreamy French girl. Paul Henreid, who was seen as the German agent in &quot;Night Train,&quot; is a fine combination of sensitivity and rugged determination as the flier. Thomas Mitchell brings authority and tenderness to the part of the Paris priest, and May Robson is sublimely casual and cozy as a British agent. A word, too, must be said for Alexander Granach as the Gestapo leech. Without uttering a word, he makes one of the most sinister villains of the season. And Laird Cregar's performance as the head of the Paris secret police, while a bit too elaborately epicene, is nevertheless properly repulsive.\n\n&quot;Joan of Paris&quot; is a rigidly exciting and tenderly moving film. It will do as a tribute to high courage until the lamps of Paris burn oncemore.\n\nJOAN OF PARISÃ¢â‚¬â€Screen play by Charles Bennett and Ellis St. Joseph; from a story by Jacques Thery and Georges Kessel; directed by Robert Stevenson; produced by David Hempstead for RKO Radio Pictures.
