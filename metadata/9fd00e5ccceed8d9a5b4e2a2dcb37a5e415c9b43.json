The former reflects an \nalmost obvious and logical addition to Ostgut Ton's allover objective to deliver \nnothing else but pure club music, just proofed by recent works as of \nDettmann and Fengler - although &quot;Shedding The Past&quot; does not follow their \nart of straight, stripped down and raw repetitiveness. For the latter - Shed's \nirresistible intense techno sound - this first album represents a first \nculmination point of years of continous Soloaction research. The recordings \nfully unfold the total variety of his outstanding crafts of sound.\n\nSo, what's in here? One could think of Saunderson Detroit sound, Aphex Twin \nrave and Manix hardcore - but that does not seem to be the point. Rather \nthe &quot;Archive Document&quot; - making one believe to present an archaeological \nfinding of media of an epoch far ahead - is the key. The voice announces \n&quot;Shedding The Past&quot; as a paradoxon, because &quot;[ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â ] it fuels so much the \nemotional feeling of the intensity and purity of club and rave in the early days \nwithout resembling those gone moments. Rather it creates a new virgin \nmoment in us built upon and leaving our past at the very same time.&quot; Further \nit sees the irresistibility of the recordings when characterizing &quot;[t]he new in \nhis sound - full of energy and vigor, not yet touched, used or exploited. \n&quot;Finally the document's conclusion delivers both its own argumentation's and \n&quot;Shedding The Past&quot;'s concentrate: &quot;true techno music&quot;.\n\nThere is a sheer easiness founding the attractiveness of all of his musical \nproductions. This easiness appears to be a natural inner trait with eastern \ngermany born, raised and socialised Shed. Both musical and social carreer \nseem to profoundly live from this inner easiness, finally and logically catching \ntechno institutions's Berghain and Hard Wax ears. As others of his social \nprovenience, Shed took on the opportunities of the early nineties techno \nculture, which unfolded after the Wall went down, and developed an \napproach of &quot;just doing it&quot;. With this easiness in mind &quot;Shedding The Past&quot; is \njust &quot;true techno music&quot;.
