Its music incorporates pop styles with elements of dance-pop, rock in the form of upbeat songs and piano-driven ballads. Aguilera described the album as a &quot;rebirth&quot; to her, drawing inspiration from events in her life, including the low sales figures of her sixth studio album Bionic (2010), her appearance on The Voice, and her divorce. The album was recorded at Aguilera's home studio. As executive producer, she collaborated with a wide range of producers, including new partners Alex da Kid, Max Martin, Lucas Secon and Tracklacers.  Upon its release, Lotus received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who were ambivalent towards its lyrics and found its music conventional. It debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 73,408 units. Internationally, the album charted moderately. Two singles were released from the album. The first single, &quot;Your Body&quot; charted within the top 40 of most countries. The second one, &quot;Just a Fool&quot;, a duet with The Voice fellow Blake Shelton and has peaked at number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100. Though not released as a single, &quot;Let There Be Love&quot; topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs and in August 2013 along with a letter to her fans, Aguilera gifted fans with a music video for the song..\n\n[u]CD - Track Listings[/u]\n\n[01] Lotus Intro\n[02] Army Of Me\n[03] Red Hot Kinda Love\n[04] Make The World Move - - - Christina Aguilera Featuring Cee Lo Green\n[05] Your Body\t\n[06] Let There Be Love\n[07] Sing For Me\n[08] Blank Page\n[09] Cease Fire\n[10] Around The World\n[11] Circles\n[12] Best Of Me\n[13] Just A Fool - - - Christina Aguilera &amp; Blake Shelton\n[14] Light Up The Sky\t\n[15] Empty Words\n[16] Shut Up\n[17] Your Body (Martin Garrix Remix)\n\n\tCD Play Time - 01h:03m:00s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 463mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
