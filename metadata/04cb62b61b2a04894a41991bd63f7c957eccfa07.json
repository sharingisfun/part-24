This track was not available as FLAC in complete form, only as MP3, so I decided to do some cut-pasting and join both the original FLAC remix by Andy Blueman and the later released one with Eller's guitar on A State Of Trance as a mixed track.\r\n\r\nThe audio has been cut exactly to the point, so apart from the slight differences in bass in Eller's version, there's literally no difference between lossless from the studio and lossless on my end, considering both the tracks which have been joined together are FLAC and the final audio has been exported to FLAC too. ALbum art has been added, as is accurate meta-data for the track.\r\n\r\nPlease report any problems with the track. This is my first rework of any music track (on complete lack of any knowledge on how to make music), so if possible, I'll try to rectify it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04cb62b61b2a04894a41991bd63f7c957eccfa07","amp;dn":"2009+-+Robert+Nickson+-+Circles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04cb62b61b2a04894a41991bd63f7c957eccfa07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,203,98,182,27,42,4,137,74,65,153,27,214,63,124,149,126,204,250,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
