It was directed by John Badham and written by Steve Tesich (who had previously won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for the similarly themed 1979 movie Breaking Away).\n\nThe 7-Eleven team that is featured in the movie was a real life team that competed in the Tour de France in the '80s. The team was later sponsored by Motorola. Much of the race action was filmed at the Coors Classic, a now-defunct stage race that was one of the world's leading cycling events at the time of the film. Two stages in the film's featured race, the Morgul-Bismarck circuit race in Boulder and the &quot;Tour of the Moon&quot; at Colorado National Monument, were legendary Coors Classic stages.\n\nThe cycling legend Eddy Merckx made a brief appearance, starting stage 1. Jennifer Grey made an appearance as a blind date, made hysterical by the brothers' arguing.\n\nSports physician Marcus persuades his younger brother David to come with him and train for a bicycle race across the Rocky Mountains, called &quot;The Hell of the West&quot;. However, there is a history of cerebral aneurysm in their family (which killed their father) and one of the brothers is destined never to finish the race.\n\n\n\nLanguages: English, French\nSubs:      English, French\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1 \nClosed Captioned\nWidescreen\nNTSC\n\n\n\nUntouched\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95448ed50527fb4da9fb1357b4ae65d425028f1f","amp;dn":"American+Flyers+%281985%29++DVD-R++NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95448ed50527fb4da9fb1357b4ae65d425028f1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,68,142,213,5,39,251,77,169,251,19,87,180,174,101,212,37,2,143,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
