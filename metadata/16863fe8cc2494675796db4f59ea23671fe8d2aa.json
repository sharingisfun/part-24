Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL Licence.\n\nBased on a powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendlyness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.\n\nThis project is mature. However, there may be still some bugs and missing features that are being worked on. If you have any questions or suggestions about this project, please post them in the forums. Also, if you wish to make a feature request, you can post it there as well. But there's no guarantee that I'll implement your request.\n\nI hope you enjoy Notepad++ as much as I enjoy coding it.\n\n\nHere are the features of Notepad++ :\t\n\nSyntax Highlighting and Syntax Folding \n\n\nSupported languages : \tC\tC++\tJava\tC#\tXML\tHTML\nPHP\tCSS\tmakefile\tASCII art (.nfo)\tdoxygen\tini file\nbatch file\tJavascript\tASP\tVB/VBS\tSQL\tObjective-C\nRC resource file\tPascal\tPerl\tPython\tLua\tTeX\nTCL\tAssembler\tRuby\tLisp\tScheme\tProperties\nDiff\tSmalltalk\tPostscript\tVHDL\tAda\tCaml\nAutoIt\tKiXtart\tMatlab\tVerilog\tHaskell\tInnoSetup\nCMake\tYAML\n\n\nWYSIWYG \n\n\nIf you have a colour printer, print your source code (or whatever you want) in colour. \n\n\nUser Defined Syntax Highlighting \n\n\nIt allows user to define his own language : not only the syntax highlighting keywords, but also the syntax folding keywords, comment keywords and the operators.\n\n\nAuto-completion \n\n\nFor most supported languages, user can make his/her own API list. Once the api file is ready, type Ctrl+Space to launch this action.\n\n\nMulti-Document \n\n\nYou can edit several documents at the same time. \n\n\nMulti-View \n\n\nYou have two views at same time. That means you can visualize (edit) 2 different documents at the same time. You can visualize (edit) in the 2 views one document at 2 different positions as well. The modification of document in one view will carry out in another view (i.e. you modify the SAME document when you are in clone mode). \n\n\nRegular Expression Search/Replace supported \n\n\nYou can search and replace one string in the document by using the regular expression. \n\n\nFull Drag ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“N' Drop supported \n\n\nYou can open a document by drag &amp; drop. You can also move your document from a position (or even a view) to another by drag &amp; drop. \n\n\nDynamic position of Views \n\n\nThe user can set the position of the views dynamically (only in 2 views mode : the splitter can be set in horizontal or in vertical). \n\n\nFile Status Auto-detection \n\n\nIf you modify or delete a file which opened in Notepad++, you will be notified to update your document (reload the file or remove the file). \n\n\nZoom in and zoom out \n\n\nThat's another fantastic function of Scintilla component.\n\n\nMulti-Language environment supported \n\n\nThe Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Hebrew Windows environments are supported.\n\n\nBookmark \n\n\nUser can just click on the bookmark margin (located right side of line number margin) or type Ctrl+F2 to toggle a book mark. To reach the bookmark, type just F2 (Next bookmark) or Shift+F2 (Previous bookmark). To clear all bookmarks, click the Menu Search-&gt;Clear All bookmarks.\n\n\nBrace and Indent guideline Highlighting \n\n\nWhen the caret stay beside of one of those symbol { } [ ] ( ) , the symbol beside of caret and its symmetric opposite symbol will be highlighted, as well as the indent guideline (if any) in order to locate the block more easily.\n\n\nMacro recording and playback \n\n\nYou can save several macros and edit their keyboard shorcuts for the next use.\n\n\nNotepad++ v5.1.2 fixed bugs (from v5.1.1) :\n\n1.  Fix localization (Japanese/Cyrillic/Hebrew...) display bug under Notepad++ Unicode version.\n2.  Fix Find in Files search in both Unicode/ANSI files.\n3.  Make Find in files thread-less to improve the performance and to avoid the crash.\n4.  Fix crash bug while loading File of User Defined Language.\n5.  Fix writing a key in registry while preference dialog launches\n6.  Fix crash in File Dialog if too many languages or extensions were added.\n7.  Fix memory leak when a file cannot be opened if it consumes too much memory.\n8.  Fix a vista issue : prevent Notepad++ save files to &quot;virtual store&quot; under vista.\n9.  Fusion 2 commands &quot;activate main view&quot; and &quot;activate sub view&quot; in &quot;Focus the other view&quot;.\n10. Fix close all files/app exit cancel bug.\n11. Fix default button problem in Find in Files dialog.\n12. Fix caret position moving problem after loading a session.\n13.
