Nomadic shepherds, plagued by drought, happen on a fishing encampment with plentiful fresh water. The local men are away but will return when it rains; the shepherds stay to refresh their flock until the rain comes. A shepherd lad and a local girl, both on the verge of puberty, start a mating dance. Also, one of the shepherds approaches a beautiful local woman, inviting her to sleep with him. How will she respond? She's married, her husband at sea for the week. Is love forever or temporary? A subtext dramatizes the capture of fish, birds, foxes, and other animals: their fates seem arbitrary.\n\nPLEASE SEED AT LEAST WHAT YOU DOWNLOAD!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e17a91eb60400248365b7052dc5b5ac0c420bc1e","amp;dn":"%26Mu%3B%26iota%3B%26kappa%3B%26rho%3B%CE%AD%26sigmaf%3B+%26Alpha%3B%26phi%3B%26rho%3B%26omicron%3B%26delta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e17a91eb60400248365b7052dc5b5ac0c420bc1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,122,145,235,96,64,2,72,54,91,112,82,220,91,90,192,196,32,188,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
