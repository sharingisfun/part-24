Our love was one for the books. When he moved next door, my entire world flipped upside down and inside out, but it was the best feeling I had ever experienced. Until the time came to choose between him and my family. I was young and in love, but in the end, I chose my family. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve regretted that decision since the day I made it. Now fate has given me a second chance with the one person I knew I was always supposed to be with. But this time so much more was standing in our way. \n\nCan I choose him over the life IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come to know? \n\nWill he be able to forgive me and give us a second chance? \n\nIs true love really enough to conquer everything standing in our way?\n\nSometimes the hardest decisions in life, are the most liberating, I just hope that this time I made the right one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9251d37e6517a2fc40a623e61ca4ff1e9eaa719a","amp;dn":"Forever+and+Almost+Always+by+Amanda+Bennett+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9251d37e6517a2fc40a623e61ca4ff1e9eaa719a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,81,211,126,101,23,162,252,64,166,35,230,28,164,255,30,158,170,113,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
