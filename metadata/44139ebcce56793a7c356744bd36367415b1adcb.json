Connect your device to the computer.\r\n2. Go into the Nuvi files located in the Garmin folder and backup \r\n   the file named â€œgmapprom.imgâ€ to your computer.\r\n3. Delete the â€œgmapprom.imgâ€ file from the device.\r\n4. Rename the file you downloaded &quot;gmapsupp.imgâ€ to â€œgmapprom.imgâ€\r\n5. Copy the unlocked â€œgmapprom.imgâ€ file that you renamed into the device. \r\n   (these copy proceedures could take up to 30 minutes to accomplish)\r\n6. Restart your device and check your map info via : Tools&gt;Settings&gt;Map&gt;Map Info.\r\n   Why the renaming?\r\nThis must be done because this is not the primary mapset as it is being used from the SD card. The primary mapset is the one on the GPSâ€™s internal memory.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart B â€“ SD Card\r\n\r\n1. Get a SD card (NOT SDHC for old unit) and format it\r\n\r\n2. Create a folder on the memory card called â€œGarminâ€\r\n\r\n3. Copy the downloaded â€œgmapsupp.imgâ€ file into the Garmin folder on your SD card.\r\n\r\n4. Insert the SD card into your Garmin GPS, and browse to your map information on your Garmin GPS and you should see the new maps selected. This can be found on the device via : Tools&gt;Settings&gt;Map&gt;Map Info.\r\n\r\n5.
