This sequel&amp;#039;s title is cribbed from its groundbreaking predecessor, In the Heat of the Night, but similarities end there, since this engaging murder mystery owes more to &quot;blaxpo&quot; and the urban police procedurals that dominated film and TV in the early 1970s. Poitier&amp;#039;s got plenty of proto-funk charisma (and a Quincy Jones groove) as San Francisco detective Virgil Tibbs, dominating his Caucasian colleagues with quiet fortitude and sure-fire instincts. His latest case is rife with likely suspects, including a Bible-thumping reformer (Martin Landau) and a sleazy landlord (Anthony Zerbe). It&amp;#039;s a routine plot by latter-day standards, but director Gordon Douglas enlivens it with solid character details: Poitier&amp;#039;s scenes with his defiant young son (George Spell) are genuinely moving, and performances are uniformly superb. Poitier did another sequel, The Organization (1971), ending his Tibbs trilogy on a high note of success.\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7270e327d1fa24a71a4d4b447ac6642dc282c58","amp;dn":"They+Call+Me+MISTER+Tibbs%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7270e327d1fa24a71a4d4b447ac6642dc282c58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,39,14,50,125,31,162,74,113,164,212,180,71,172,102,66,220,40,44,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
