Walcott's sitar and Abercrombie's fluid, singing guitar dance and exchange ideas over one of the greatest rhythm sections in jazz.  This isn't an airy fairy &quot;world beat&quot; record -- it's tight, lyrical, reflective music from four masters at the peak of their careers.  It's a shame the late Walcott didn't record three more albums with this band.  &quot;Margueritte&quot; and the title track are two of the most poignant melodies I know. Any fan of honest, exploratory, moody jazz should check this out. ~ Stephen Silberman\n\n&quot;Simply put, each time this disc plays, it reveals something new to the listener.  The meditative mood is ripped by the slicing of Abercrombie's guitar on Scimitar, but other than that, one floats through the atmosphere, somewhere between Manhattan and the Himalayan foothills, wrapped in the warm tones of this veteran group.&quot;\n\nPersonnel:\nCollin Walcott (Sitar and Tabla) \nJohn Abercrombie (Guitar) \nDave Holland (Double Bass) \nJack DeJohnette (Drums) \n\nCollin Walcott - Cloud Dance Tracks: \n01  Margueritte (Collin Walcott) 8:34 \n02  Prancing (Collin Walcott) 3:26 \n03  Night Glider (Collin Walcott) 6:42 \n04  Scimitar (Collin Walcott/John Abercrombie) 2:48 \n05  Vadana (Dave Holland) 7:02 \n06  Eastern Song (Collin Walcott) 2:36 \n07  Padma (Collin Walcott/John Abercrombie) 2:49 \n08  Cloud Dance (Collin Walcott) 5:47 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5ab7c75d2e767b5cfcaa667b6c89f30580c4612","amp;dn":"Collin+Walcott+-+Cloud+Dance+%281975%29+%5BJazz+Sitar%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5ab7c75d2e767b5cfcaa667b6c89f30580c4612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,171,124,117,210,231,103,181,207,202,166,103,182,200,159,48,88,12,70,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
