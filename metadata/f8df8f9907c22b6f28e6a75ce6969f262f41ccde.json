His formidable intellectual abilities soon won him honour and respect at the court of the famous Seljuqi Prime Minister, Nizam al-Mulk, and, while still in his early thirties, he became Professor at Madrasa Nizamiyya in Baghdad and attained great prominence there. But soon he abandoned his professorship for a decade of contemplation and study. He returned for a while to lecture at the Nizamiyya in Nishapur before his death. He wrote a large number of works, which include Al-Munqidh min al-Dalal (a biographical account), Tahafut al-Falasifa; but his magnum opus remains the IhyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ulum al-Din in four volumes, compiled during his period of retirement and contemplation.\n\n----------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8df8f9907c22b6f28e6a75ce6969f262f41ccde","amp;dn":"Inner+Dimensions+of+Islamic+Worship+by+Al-Ghazali+-+Yasser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8df8f9907c22b6f28e6a75ce6969f262f41ccde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,223,143,153,7,194,43,111,40,230,167,92,230,150,159,38,47,65,204,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
