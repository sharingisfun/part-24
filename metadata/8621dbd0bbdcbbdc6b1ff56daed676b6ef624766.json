There?s a good case that modern day Melodic Power Metal was born from one particular \n\ntrack on this masterpiece. That track namely the eight minute opus ??Stargazer?? it contains enough might for the \n\nMetalheads, lengthy instrumental passages for the nerdy Prog types and is without doubt the best song written by \n\nBlackmore and Dio at any time in their careers.\n??Stargazer?? is a behemoth of a song amongst an album that only spans thirty three minutes and contains another eight \n\nminute wonder in ??A Light In The Black?? Back in the 70?s Prog bands had just turned on the amps the time ??Rising?? \n\nfinishes and ??Stargazer?? was to provide a template for all the Melodic Metal bands that came after RAINBOW showing just \n\nhow to write and perform a true epic. But lets take nothing away from the striking bitterness of fame in ??Starstruck?? or \n\nthe opening stomp of ??Tarot Women??.\nThe third RAINBOW offering ??Long Live Rock N Roll?? had it moments but it failed to match the pomp and ceremony of this \n\nground breaking record. I very much doubt Blackmore or Dio have recorded better. Ever.\n \n\nReview Taken from rollingstone.com:\n From Deep Purple&amp;#039;s earliest recordings to this second album with his solo group, there&amp;#039;s no mistaking a record in which \n\nRitchie Blackmore is involved. Here, abetted by lyricist/vocalist Ronnie Dio, guitarist/composer Blackmore continues to lord \n\nover his peculiarly dark corner of the universe. The problem, compounded on both Rainbow albums by the lyrics, lies in \n\nthe discrepancy between the listener&amp;#039;s and Blackmore/Dio&amp;#039;s reality. Evil is the prominent subject, but what&amp;#039;s portrayed is \n\neither too ambiguous (the apparently diabolical wizard in &quot;Stargazer&quot;) or too mundane (the autograph-hunting groupie in \n\n&quot;Starstruck&quot;) to merit attention.\nBlackmore&amp;#039;s songs have a predilection for minor modes and simple riffs punctuated predictably and often with syncopated \n\npower chording; the result is disjointed, grandiose and humorless?a gothic heavy-metal style.\nDio is certainly the match for Blackmore, in both his relentlessly impassioned warbling vocals and his lyrics, which uncover \n\napocalypse at every turn. &quot;There&amp;#039;s a hole in the sky/Something evil&amp;#039;s passing by&quot; Dio spits and snarls, but what he is \n\ndescribing is usually called spring fever. Even after Blackmore mounts the most successful musical attack of the album, \n\nreplete with Who-like slashing guitar chords, all Dio can muster?albeit with exceptional angst?is: &quot;Do you close your \n\neyes/When you&amp;#039;re making love?&quot; If this is the denouement, what&amp;#039;s all the fuss about?\nBlackmore&amp;#039;s guitar soloing has always been the saving grace of his compositions. He has a full-bodied, fluid style, most \n\neffectively displayed here on &quot;A Light in the Black,&quot; and he can stutter and wail with the best blues-rock guitarists. \n\nUnfortunately, on Rising the setting is too distracting. In a less gloomily banal context, his playing might shine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8621dbd0bbdcbbdc6b1ff56daed676b6ef624766","amp;dn":"Rainbow+-+Rising+%281976%29+%28Remastered%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8621dbd0bbdcbbdc6b1ff56daed676b6ef624766","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,33,219,208,187,220,187,220,107,31,245,109,174,214,118,182,239,98,71,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
