His model is based on the appraisal process that the individual undertakes in combat conditions to assess a situation, whether it concerns him or not and regardless of his role. It is through this process that the individual makes a judgment, taking into consideration his past experience, knowledge, and expectations, that in turn leads to a course of action.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80e1d0383b8ac3f3034ef097fe97ef1ac0f3805c","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1988%5D+The+Psychology+of+Conflict+and+Combat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80e1d0383b8ac3f3034ef097fe97ef1ac0f3805c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,225,208,56,59,138,195,243,3,78,240,151,254,151,239,26,192,243,128,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
