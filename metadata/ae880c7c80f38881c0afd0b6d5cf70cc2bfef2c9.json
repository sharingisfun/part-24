Ribit was actually a lizard who was created by a female sorcerer named Sahtee, as a pet for Thong (who was SahteeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aide). Thong was a good-natured fat man who constantly wished for a woman to love. Sahtee later became engaged in battle with an evil army to win back control over her kingdom. One night, Sahtee prepared a magical brew that was intended to create a warrior-woman. Sahtee believed that a female warrior would prove less conspicuous to her enemies and could therefore easily infiltrate the opposing forceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s base camp. Moments before the ceremony, Ribit jumped into the brew and then emerged as a green warrior who loved Thong. And as it turned out, Ribit did prove to be more than a match for her enemies. You can easily find these four issues for cheap, and if you are a fan of Frank Thorne's work on Red Sonja, Ghita of Alizarr or Lann, then these issues will also entertain you.\n\nPlease Seed and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae880c7c80f38881c0afd0b6d5cf70cc2bfef2c9","amp;dn":"Ribit%21+%28Comico+-+1987+%29%28Rumor-Novus%29+Frank+Thorne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae880c7c80f38881c0afd0b6d5cf70cc2bfef2c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,136,12,124,128,243,136,129,192,175,208,182,213,207,112,204,43,254,242,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
