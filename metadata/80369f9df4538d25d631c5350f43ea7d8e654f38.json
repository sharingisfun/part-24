My 3D TV will play .mkv files from a USB drive but the format needs to be specifically 1080p video with AC3 audio. This will also be the case for many other 3D TV owners out there. A lot of uploaded 3D content seems to have DTS audio and various video resolutions, which requires decoding to a playable format. So I thought I would upload my decoded content to save other users the headache, hassle and time. I have also decided to maintain a max movie/file size of 4GB to accommodate the use of a FAT32 formatted USB drive.\n\nVideo Stream\nCodec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10) (avc1)\nResolution: 1920x1080\nFrame Rate: 25\n\nAudio Stream\nCodec: A52 Audio (aka AC3) (a52)\nLanguage: English\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44100 Hz\nBitrate: 64 kb/s\n\nPlease help seed!\n\nCheers\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/1989/superstrip20103d1080pha.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/1989/superstrip20103d1080pha.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80369f9df4538d25d631c5350f43ea7d8e654f38","amp;dn":"Super+Strip+2010+3D+1080p+Half-SBS+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80369f9df4538d25d631c5350f43ea7d8e654f38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,54,159,157,244,83,141,37,214,49,197,53,15,67,234,125,142,101,79,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
