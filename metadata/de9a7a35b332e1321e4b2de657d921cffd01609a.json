There are excellent musicians on this album including, Steve Lukather, Jeff Porcaro, David Foster, Ray Parker, Jr., and Carlos Santana. Lukather's guitar really shines on this album as well as Foster's piano playing. The Vocals are strong and music is very smooth and crisp.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de9a7a35b332e1321e4b2de657d921cffd01609a","amp;dn":"Boz+Scaggs+-+Middle+Man+%5B1980%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de9a7a35b332e1321e4b2de657d921cffd01609a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,154,122,53,179,50,225,50,30,75,45,230,87,217,33,207,253,1,96,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
