A small miscalculation sends her through the roof of an enchanted chateau. Stranded until her broken leg mends, Elle is forced to rely on the good will of the sour chateau owner Ã¢â‚¬â€the cursed Prince Severin.\n\nPrince SeverinÃ¢â‚¬â€the commanding general and staunch supporter of his brother the crown princeÃ¢â‚¬â€is cursed to look like a beast until a maiden falls in love with him. However, he has given up all hope of shattering the curse after several painful and failed attempts to break it. As such he has only disdain for Elle, leaving her to the devices of his bossy servants. This suits Elle perfectly as she dislikes the entire royal family, Severin included.\n\nUnfortunately for the unsuspecting pair, the chateau servants are determined to break the curse and spend the majority of their time pushing Elle and Severin together. After bonding over gardens, animals, and terrifying squirrels Elle and Severin show signs of friendship, and perhaps something moreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nBut not all love stories can end that easily. After all, Elle is not what she seems, and SeverinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is placed in danger when hostilities flare between his brother and the monarchs of a neighboring country.\n\nIf they really want the love of a lifetime Elle, a loyal liar, and Severin, an indifferent beast, will have to use every trick they know to survive.\n\nCinderella and The Colonel\n\nThe country of Erlauf is the enemy, as far as Cinderella is concerned. Since Erlauf took over her home country, Cinderella has been forced to manage her once opulent duchy like a tightly budgeted farm. Gone are the days of wealth and luxury. Instead, Cinderella dons servantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ clothes and sells all her luxuries to save her servants and her duchy from the mountain of debt sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s racked up due to Erlauf fines and taxes.\n\nRomance and forgiveness are the last things on CinderellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind. Unfortunately the rakish Erlauf Colonel Friedrich has other ideas.\n\nCinderella thinks she needs a pile of money to save her duchy, and for the Erlauf invaders to leave. What she gets is a debonair Erlauf colonel, a fairy godmother, four mice, two goats, a pair of glass slippers, and a pumpkin.\n\nThe Wild Swans\n\nElise is no hero. She would rather balance the castleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expense accounts than become her countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s champion. But she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a choice since her step-mother, a wicked witch, cursed the seven princes of Arcainia, EliseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foster-brothers, and transformed them into swans. To free her foster-brothers Elise agrees to knit seven shirts made of stinging nettles. She must complete the shirts without uttering a word.\n\nFor the sake of safety and secrecy, Elise flees Arcainia and struggles to survive in the wild. Even though she is mute, trails seven wild swans, and knits like a mad-woman, Elise catches the eye of a foreign prince, who drags her back to his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s castle where she is tormented by the princeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evil father. With her step-mother hunting her foster-brothers and the foreign king threatening to kill her, EliseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dedication to her task is sorely tested. But if Elise does not finish the shirts, Arcainia and her foster-brothers will be lost. Can a mathematician be the hero needed to save the day?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df3af7c7c523848a9634c8a5ed5a3f7616868364","amp;dn":"Timeless+Fairy+Tales+-+K.M.Shea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df3af7c7c523848a9634c8a5ed5a3f7616868364","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,58,247,199,197,35,132,138,150,52,200,165,237,90,63,118,22,134,131,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
