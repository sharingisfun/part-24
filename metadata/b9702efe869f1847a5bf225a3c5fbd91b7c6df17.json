After emerging out of nowhere with 2008's self-released 3 Rounds and a Sound ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that year's most solidly appealing record, if not its best outright ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Portland, Ore., band has toured with The Decemberists, been showcased on Morning Edition, and recorded a lovely, gently appealing follow-up called We Are the Tide.\n\nOut Sept. 13, We Are the Tide blooms agreeably from start to finish. Though Blind Pilot locates extra energy on the live stage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the band's sound has tightened over time, as it's expanded from the duo of Israel Nebeker and Ryan Dobrowski to a large and fleshed-out sextet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the new record focuses more on lush, pretty concoctions like the album-opening &quot;Half Moon.&quot; We Are the Tide benefits enormously once Blind Pilot introduces a bit of thumping propulsion in the record's title track, but the softer material radiates warmth, too.\n\nFor all their lack of rock 'n' roll flash ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nebeker and Dobrowski have logged thousands of miles' worth of touring on bicycles, even after Blind Pilot's audience grew well beyond the West Coast ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ these guys make remarkably sturdy, gorgeous songs. With its broad appeal and good-natured grace, We Are the Tide stands to keep them off the bikes and in buses for the foreseeable future. Environmental impact aside, that can only be a good thing.\n\nCD RIPPED BY A MATE using X Lossless Decoder and getting a 100% log.\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/07/01/blind-pilot/[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9702efe869f1847a5bf225a3c5fbd91b7c6df17","amp;dn":"Blind+Pilot...We+Are+The+Tide%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9702efe869f1847a5bf225a3c5fbd91b7c6df17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,112,46,254,134,159,24,71,165,191,34,90,60,95,189,145,183,198,223,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
