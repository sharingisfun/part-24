Through an objective examination of the two drugs and the laws and social practices that steer people toward alcohol, the authors pose a simple yet rarely considered question: Why do we punish adults who make the rational, safer choice to use marijuana instead of alcohol?\n\nMarijuana Is Safer reaches for a broad audience. For those unfamiliar with marijuana, it provides an introduction to the cannabis plant and its effects on the user, and debunks some of the government's most frequently cited marijuana myths. For current and aspiring advocates of marijuana-law reform, as well as anyone else who is interested in what is becoming a major political battle, the authors spell out why the message that marijuana is safer than alcohol must be a prominent part of the public debate over legalization.\n\nMost importantly, for the millions of Americans who want to advance the cause of marijuana-policy reform--or simply want to defend their own personal, safer choice--this book provides the talking points and detailed information needed to make persuasive arguments to friends, family, coworkers, and elected officials.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Marijuana-Safer-Driving-People-Drink/dp/1603581448/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1306703946&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Marijuana-Safer-Driving-People-Drink/dp/1603581448/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1306703946&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd46e05822f94296a1bce646a0175ee6edbe3fca","amp;dn":"Marijuana+is+Safer%3A+So+Why+Are+We+Driving+People+to+Drink%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd46e05822f94296a1bce646a0175ee6edbe3fca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,70,224,88,34,249,66,150,161,188,230,70,160,23,94,230,237,190,63,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
