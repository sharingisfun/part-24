The most accepted way to determine the friction factor has been to use the traditional Moody diagram or the AGA calculation method. This book demonstrates that these traditional methods easily lead to 10 % inaccuracies in the pressure drop calculations, in some cases significantly more.\n\nMost books about transient gas pipe flow focus exclusively on how to simulate perfect gases. Real gases differ from perfect gases is some important respects, and perfect gas models are most useful as a reference for testing out simulation methods or for very low pressure pipes. Ideal gas models cannot be used in general simulation programs intended for both high and low pressure pipelines. Therefore, all gas theory in this book is developed with reference to real gases, and ideal gas models are used for reference or testing purposes only.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a70282dd262fb6d7f9a8505010882e0a44eec2d4","amp;dn":"%28Ebook%29+transient+pipe+flow+in+pipelines+and+networks+-+the+newe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a70282dd262fb6d7f9a8505010882e0a44eec2d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,2,130,221,38,47,182,215,249,168,80,80,16,136,46,10,68,238,194,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
