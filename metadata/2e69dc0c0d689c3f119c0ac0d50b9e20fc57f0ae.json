The idea behind the project is to blend North Eastern Brazilian music with Jamaican. As you can hear from the trailer itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite a smooth blend with those Trad Brazilian rhythms such as ForrÃƒÂ³ and Maracatu mixing almost seamlessly with the Jamaican skank. I rate Bid as producer, in 2005 he released Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bambas &amp; BiritasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which was superb example of modern MPB and stayed on the household stereo for months, a rare thing nowadays.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e69dc0c0d689c3f119c0ac0d50b9e20fc57f0ae","amp;dn":"Bambas+Dois+-+Jamaica%2C+Brasil.+Mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e69dc0c0d689c3f119c0ac0d50b9e20fc57f0ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,105,220,12,13,104,156,63,17,156,10,192,213,11,158,32,252,87,240,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
