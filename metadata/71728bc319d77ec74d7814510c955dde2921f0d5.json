It\nemphasizes the role of computer languages as vehicles for expressing\nknowledge and it presents basic principles of abstraction and\nmodularity, together with essential techniques for designing and\nimplementing computer languages. This course has had a worldwide\nimpact on computer science curricula over the past two decades.\n\nThese twenty video lectures by Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman are\na complete presentation of the course, given in July 1986 for\nHewlett-Packard employees, and professionally produced by\nHewlett-Packard Television. The videos have been used extensively in\ncorporate training at Hewlett-Packard and other companies, as well as\nat several universities and in MIT short courses for industry.\n========================================================================\nThese video lectures are copyright by Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay\nSussman.
