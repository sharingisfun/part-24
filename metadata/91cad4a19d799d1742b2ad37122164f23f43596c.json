The problems are set within the framework of three villages--Ayling, Beeling, and Ceiling--their inhabitants, and the relationships (spacial and social) between them.\n The problems can be solved with little formal mathematical knowledge, although most require considerable thought and mental dexterity, and solutions are all clearly expounded in non-technical language. Stimulating and unusual, this book proves what Hugh ApSimon has known all along: mathematics can be fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91cad4a19d799d1742b2ad37122164f23f43596c","amp;dn":"+Mathematical+Byways+in+Ayling%2C+Beeling%2C+and+Ceiling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91cad4a19d799d1742b2ad37122164f23f43596c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,202,212,161,157,121,157,23,66,178,173,55,18,33,100,242,63,67,89,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
