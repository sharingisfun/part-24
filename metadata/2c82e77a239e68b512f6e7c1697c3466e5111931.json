To decide the title for his newest album, a competition was run on the rapper's website asking fans for their suggestions for album names. As a result of the competition, several names were short-listed and finally they were voted on and Venom was chosen by fans as the title for his third album. Chamillionaire spoke on the reversal of mind stating:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ \t...not wanting to use it anymore was for creative reasons but others seemed to disagree because of marketing reasons. So I figured that I would put it up there so you all could decide and help me prove I'm not crazy. Looks like I am crazy. Venom it is.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c82e77a239e68b512f6e7c1697c3466e5111931","amp;dn":"Chamillionaire+-+Good+Morning++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c82e77a239e68b512f6e7c1697c3466e5111931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,130,231,122,35,158,104,181,18,246,231,193,105,124,52,102,229,17,25,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
