Her incompetence and the Defense secretaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s haste cause it to be tested too soon, stirring unprecedented solar flares, ultimately a plasma causing disasters on all continents. Only the genius can think of a way out, only to be victimized by the secretary, who needs to cover up. Even when it turns out the earthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core has stopped spinning, spelling an unimaginable seismic apocalypse, the genius must still evade special forces to stay free and save the world again.\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2336630/\nRelease Date: 2013\nGenre: Sci-Fi\nStars : Matthew Modine, Maxim Roy, Ted Whittall\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: SHQ@Ganool\nSource: 720p.BluRay.x264-PHD\nSize: 1.2GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:803f5f9b2e682e52e60c9ebfc8025d2fc94480a8","amp;dn":"CAT.8.+%282013%29+BluRay+720p+x264+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"803f5f9b2e682e52e60c9ebfc8025d2fc94480a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,63,95,155,46,104,46,82,230,12,158,191,200,2,93,47,201,68,128,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
