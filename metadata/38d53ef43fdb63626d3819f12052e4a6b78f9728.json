But Sharmeen discovers that life has only changed for a privileged few. Just streets away from one shopping mall she finds homeless women wearing burqas forced to beg, steal and sell their bodies to feed their children.\n\nSharmeen is taken by one woman to her &amp;#039;home&amp;#039; - a bombed-out block of flats in Western Kabul, an area rarely visited by Western journalists. Here she explains how her husband was killed in the invasion forcing her to beg to ensure her daughters&amp;#039; survival. This woman is just one of an estimated two million widows in a country where women are dependent on men.\n\nTo begin to get an idea about what women like her face everyday, Sharmeen wears a full burqa and a secret camera and joins her on the streets. She records the reactions of the men passing by and how women are still made to feel like second-class citizens.\n\nSharmeen travels to a burns unit at a hospital in the Western province of Herat to investigate the growing number of self-immolation cases. She meets patients and doctors and discovers that for many women facing domestic violence, rape and forced marriages suicide is the only means of escape. But for survivors, the stigma attached to suicide mean many of them claim the burns were an accident as their families seek to conceal it.\n\nIn one moving interview, a girl of 12 tells Sharmeen how she was sold by her opiate-addicted father to her future husband at the age of seven - she burnt herself from the waist down when she became old enough to know what her fate was.\n\nIn Taloqan, in the far north, Sharmeen visits a maternity ward at a hospital to find out why the country has the second highest infant mortality rate in the world. She meets female doctors who explain that women need their male guardian&amp;#039;s written permission to go to hospital - which is often difficult to obtain and finds that many women have little or no access to basic prenatal and postnatal care so childbirth can often signal a death sentence for a mother and her baby. Promised western aid to modernise the hospital has never materialised.\n\nSharmeen then travels to the remote province of Takhar to visit a girl&amp;#039;s school which appears to offer some hope. Whereas under the Taliban the girls had to be taught in secret, the headmistress can now hold classes in the open and many of the girls are unveiled. However Sharmeen soon discovers that their enthusiasm for education is not shared by their fathers and their employment prospects are bleak. Throughout her journey, Sharmeen finds little evidence of Western aid making a difference to the lives of women. The streets of Kabul are full of aid workers in flash &amp;#039;four by fours&amp;#039;, but the lives of ordinary people have hardly changed.\n\nSharmeen concludes that the liberation of Afghan women is mostly theoretical: it was naÃƒÂ¯ve to think that the country could be transformed quickly, when the oppression of women was the consequence of centuries of tribal and cultural practice - not the sole invention of the Taliban. The West should be asking hard questions about where all the millions of aid money has gone, with so little to show.\n\nFile Information\n\nDVBT-T (Freeview) Capture\nConverted using Gordian Knot\nResolution = 640x352\nVideo Codec = XviD\nAudio = 128kbps CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38d53ef43fdb63626d3819f12052e4a6b78f9728","amp;dn":"20070517+-+UK+-+Dispatches+-+Afghanistan+Unveiled","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38d53ef43fdb63626d3819f12052e4a6b78f9728","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,213,62,244,63,219,99,98,109,56,25,241,32,82,228,166,183,143,151,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
