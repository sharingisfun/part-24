The book focuses on the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, which was besieged by Bosnian Serbs during the war; Sacco spent four weeks in Gorazde, entering before the Muslims trapped inside had access to the outside world, electricity or running water.\n\nReleased in 2000, Safe Area Gorazde confirmed Sacco as one of the preeminent journalists of his time, and earned him a 2001 Guggenheim Fellowship. Now for its 10th anniversary, Fantagraphics is releasing an expanded hardcover edition which, much like 2007Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Palestine: The Special Edition, supplements the original work with page after page of related drawings, on-site sketches, photographs, and transcripts from SaccoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notes. \t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc4b0668cc9e0e34fd1135af8f747348d8a9f88a","amp;dn":"Joe+Sacco+-+Safe+Area+Gorazde+The+Special+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc4b0668cc9e0e34fd1135af8f747348d8a9f88a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,75,6,104,204,158,14,52,253,17,53,175,143,116,115,72,216,169,248,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
