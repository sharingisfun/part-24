We'll start by learning how to set our animation preferences. We'll then have a look at reference we can use to guide us in achieving realism throughout the animation.\n\nAfter this, we'll begin our blocking pass, and from there, we'll move to refining our work with time-saving techniques. Once we've completed the cycle, we'll then learn how to translate it forward. By the end of this training, you'll have the skill-set to animate your own quadrupeds in Maya.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc7c147f74ca79a48df8e01569c812d001656846","amp;dn":"Animating+Quadrupeds+in+Maya+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc7c147f74ca79a48df8e01569c812d001656846","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,124,20,127,116,202,121,164,141,248,224,21,105,200,18,208,1,101,104,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
