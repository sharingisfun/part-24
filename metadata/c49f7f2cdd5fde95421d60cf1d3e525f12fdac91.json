Listening to these songs may help you decide whether you want to track down a copy of the game.\n\nRelated game info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_(video_game)\nSource of files: Galbadia Hotel (http://gh.ffshrine.org/)\n191k-217k\n\nI've decided to group the songs by their grouping in the game, but it won't change how you listen to them, right?\n\nEDIT: Yes, some of these are a little edited, but they DID come from a game released into the public with a &quot;T-rating&quot;, even though any 13+ year old would know the words just from having a life, possibly with public schools.\nI see it as more authentic to the game to keep them the way they are.\n\n(AAA) - denotes an original track created specifically for Amplitude\n\nStage 1 - Neotropolis\nP.O.D. vs. The Crystal Method - Boom (The Crystal Method Mix)\nGarbage - Cherry Lips\nQuarashi - Baseline\nKodomo (Chris Child) featuring Melissa Kaplan - Shades of Blue (AAA)\nLogan 7 - Uptown Saturday Night\n\nStage 2 - Beat Factory\nRun-D.M.C. - King of Rock (X-Ecutioners Mix) (AAA)\nThe Baldwin Brothers - Urban Tumbleweed\nWeezer - Dope Nose\nDavid Bowie - Everyone Says 'Hi' (Metro Mix)\nFreezepop - Super-Sprode (AAA)\n\nStage 3 - Metaclouds\nPink - Respect\nPapa Roach - M-80 (Explosive Energy Movement)\nMekon with Roxanne Shante - What's Going On\nHerbie Hancock - Rockit (2.002 Remix)\nProduction Club - Rockstar (AAA)\n\nStage 4 - Elektro Kore\nDJ HMX with Plural - Cool Baby (AAA)\nBT and Wildchild - Kimosabe (AAA)\nManchild - Nitro Narcosis (AAA)\nSlipknot - I Am Hated\nGame Boyz - Push (AAA)\n\nStage 5 - Blastlands\nBlink-182 - The Rock Show\nStyles of Beyond - Subculture (Dieselboy + Kaos Rock Remix)\nAkrobatik and Symbion Project - Out The Box (AAA)\nSymbion Project - Synthesized (AAA)\nKomputer Kontroller - Robot Rockerz (AAA)\nCosmonaut Zero - Spaztik (AAA)\n\nUL by djteka","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c49f7f2cdd5fde95421d60cf1d3e525f12fdac91","amp;dn":"Amplitude+%28Ps2%29+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c49f7f2cdd5fde95421d60cf1d3e525f12fdac91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,159,127,44,221,95,222,149,66,29,96,207,29,62,82,95,18,253,172,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
