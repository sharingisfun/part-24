The tune was written by songwriter and piano player Bolivar Lee Shook. Great name. Bolivar would steal rides on freight trains near his home in Prentiss County, Miss. He got thrown from one of those trains, injured his leg and was handicapped for life. Without manual labor for wages- he turned to music. Bolivar taught piano, singing and tuned pianoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s until he passed in 1964. Spent his childhood in a frame cabin on a hill- which overlooked a wide valley. There you go.\n \nWritten by Bolivar Lee Shook\nTim Timebomb-Vocals,Guitar\nJim Doyle-Drums\nBrett Simons- Bass\nHunter Perrin- Guitar\nJohn Morrical- Piano\nCraig Eastman- Fiddle\nKevin Bivona-Background Vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14ba8f17c2010eb9c8c10fcd6ff9dddf28185498","amp;dn":"Cabin+On+The+Hill+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14ba8f17c2010eb9c8c10fcd6ff9dddf28185498","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,186,143,23,194,1,14,185,200,193,15,205,111,249,221,223,40,24,84,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
