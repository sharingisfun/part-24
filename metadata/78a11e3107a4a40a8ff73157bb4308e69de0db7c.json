This process left her with the belief that we can only be truly healed if we find our &quot;interior God.&quot; How do you find your interior God? There are many ways, but she believes one of them is through dreams. Dreams being the closest way to have a direct experience with the all-knowing past, present, and future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78a11e3107a4a40a8ff73157bb4308e69de0db7c","amp;dn":"Orenda+Fink+-+Blue+Dream+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78a11e3107a4a40a8ff73157bb4308e69de0db7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,161,30,49,7,164,164,10,143,247,49,87,187,67,8,230,157,224,219,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
