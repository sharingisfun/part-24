Another 44 wins &amp; 19 nominations. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagaan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagaan&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis Indian film-a period musical drama about a group of drought-stricken villagers who play a cricket match against the British authorities to avoid taxation (lagaan)-is pure Bollywood. The director Ashutosh Gowariker crosses a lavish romantic epic with a muscular adventure tale and comes up with an outrageously buoyant hybrid. The musical sequences burst from the story organically, and the outdoor production numbers are composed of brilliantly edited tracking shots and spectacular choreography. Not all the performances soar (the British actors seem particularly stiff), but the romantic leads are wonderful. Aamir Khan\\\\\\&amp;#039;s masterly preening is worthy of a young Tony Curtis and his ladylove, played by Gracy Singh, does a Janet Leigh turn at getting her man. The daunting four-hour length leaves plenty of room for meandering subplots and misunderstandings, but the film is so visually alive and superbly structured-it also breaks for an intermission-that you will be happily taken in by its bighearted charms. In Hindi and English.\n\nRelease Date: 8 May 2002 (USA)\nGenre: Drama / Musical / Romance / Sport\nSubtitles: English, Arabic, Hebrew,  Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese\n\nRaw DVD. US Release.
