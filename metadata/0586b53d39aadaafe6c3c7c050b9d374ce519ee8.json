A new historical record is emerging from personal footage, photography and audio captured by survivors and onlookers near the scene.\n\n102 Minutes that Changed the World is a documentary that provides a rare and intensely personal look at the world-changing events that took place on Sept. 11. This unique documentary carefully pieces together personal footage and audiotape from amateur photography and videos, New York police and emergency dispatch radio recordings, voicemails, audio/video diaries, and outtakes culled from raw television network footage, to create a seamless historical record of those 102 minutes. The result is an evocative memorial to the 2,603 lives lost and a reminder of just how much our world has changed since that tragic day.\n\nThis documentary faithfully records and captures the horrific morning as it happened and the way it was experienced-from people's initial bewilderment that a plane could slam into these iconic skyscrapers on such a clear, sunny day, to the sudden, awful recognition that America was under attack. Many have said that society must never forget what happened on Sept. 11. 102 Minutes that Changed the World is an unprecedented attempt to capture the experience of that morning and preserve it as authentically as possible for future generations.\n\n102 Minutes that Changed the World was produced by Nicole Rittenmeyer and edited by Seth Skundrick for A&amp;E History Channel in the U.S.\n\n102 Minutes That Changed America is a 102-minute American television special documentary film that was produced by the History channel and premiered commercial-free on September 11, 2008, marking the seventh anniversary of the 2001 attacks. The film depicts, in virtually real time, the New York-based events of the attacks primarily using raw video footage from mostly amateur citizen journalists. The documentary is accompanied by an 18-minute documentary short called I-Witness to 9/11, which features interviews with nine firsthand eyewitnesses who captured the footage on camera.\n\nAccording to this film, most of the archival footage was in possession of the U.S. government but was released to History years after 9/11. The documentary film attracted 5.2 million viewers. The program aired on Channel 4 in the UK, France 3 in France, History Channel in Brazil on 07 September 2009, and SBS6 in the Netherlands on 09 September 2009.\n\n\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 699 MiB for 1h 27mn 45s 98ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 963 Kbps\nAspect            : 512 x 384 (1.333) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 136 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0586b53d39aadaafe6c3c7c050b9d374ce519ee8","amp;dn":"The+Passionate+Eye.102.Minutes.That.Changed.The.World.PDTV.XviD-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0586b53d39aadaafe6c3c7c050b9d374ce519ee8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,134,181,61,57,170,218,175,230,195,199,192,80,185,211,116,206,81,158,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
