That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\n\nSome changes have been made to the previously announced makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are still possible. I plan on 13 more.  Approximate sizes listed based on what I have now. I still have duplicates and replacement scans to weed out and additions are possible. The big Batman one was popular so I'll do the same with Superman. The Superman torrent will be around 43-45gb, depending on how many replacement scans are in the folder now. I think it's a lot. I will not rush part 46, so as to give you all time to download.\n\nSizes given are the current size for the folder. Things may change.\n\n43 Str-Supera              15gb\t\n44 Superb-Swd (-Superman)  15gb\n45 Superman                45gb\n46 Swe-Td                  14gb\n47 Te-Tn                   15gb\n48 To-Unk                  15gb\n49 Unl-Waq                 16gb\n50 War-Wn                  18gb\n51 Wonder*                 14gb\n52 World*                  13gb\n53 Wo-Z (-Wonder, World)   17gb\n54 Fill Torent A-D         16gb\n55 Fill Torent E-Z         17gb\n\n\n     The big thing in this is Star Trek. It's half the torrent, about 10gb. Only about 3gb of that is DC but based on past experience people like the Star Trek. It's close to all the Star Trek that's been scanned. Some of the scans are pretty small. They small ones were mostly scanned quite a while ago when hard drives were smaller. Someone has rescanned the Gold Key series at a much larger size but he did them all double paged, and I hate that. They don't fit well on some monitors when made big enough for comfortable reading. My comic reader will show me two pages at once when I want that. I like to have the choice. I hope you agree. For double page spreads, I appreciate the scanner's who give it two us both ways. Since they typically scan single paged and have to join the doubles it's an easy thing for them to do. BTW some hyphenate the page numbers, others don't e.g. 05-06 0506. The hyphenated ones sort correctly both alphabetically and numerically. Typically you can switch in a reader so it comes out all right but I know I've had questions about this.\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering:  DC beginning with Star\n\nEnjoy!\n\nI alphabetize titles with period de-marked acronyms as if the periods were not there, but computers don't. so somebody might have expected this at the star of the Ss. I make my own rules. I do what I want. Respect my authoritah!\n\nS.T.A.R. Corps 01-06 (1993-1994)\nStar Crossed 01-03 (Helix(1997)\nStar Hunters 01-07 (1977-1978)\nStar Raiders-Graphic Novel 01 65p (1983)\n\n\nStar Spangled Comics 001-130 (1941-1952)\nStar Spangled Comics v2 001 ctc (1999)\n\n     The golden age super hero comic above had it's name changed when super heroes went out of fashion for a few years. Most titles that do this continue numbers smoothly but DC rather &quot;hiccuped&quot; on this change. First they just continued the numbers for 3 issues, 131-133. Then they restarted the numbers but for some reason neither went back to one, nor did they count 131-133 as 1-3 and start at 4. Instead they started at 3 and eventually created duplicate numbers for 131-133. I renumbered the older 131-133 as 1, 2 and 2a so they sort before #3.\n\n     I suppose I could have used 0-2 but I really hate the zero issues idea. As far as I know it was never done till DC did a bunch of zero issues in November 1994 at the end of their &quot;Zero Hour&quot; event, symbolically indicating the restart of time. At least it was rarely done before then. Now it's quite common. Curse you DC! The problem I have with it is two-fold. DC's original zeros were in the middle of the numbering and so they sort to the top before number one but they do not belong there at all. Others zero comics by many publishers have since been done this way too, although sometimes they are &quot;at the side&quot; of a series, and not in direct succession. The other problem I have is that many other zero issues are the first in a series so they belong first. Why is this a problem for me? \n    Well the answer to this is two-fold. It's inconsistent, causing confusion all over the solar system. Yes I have it on good authority that incredibly alien intelligent jellyfish-like beings floating in Jupiter's atmosphere are really pissed about this. We are lucky they have no access to any solid matter, so it is unlikely they will build space craft to attack us anytime soon. Hopefully they will never develop amazing mental abilities to manipulate space-time and matter-energy. If they do, we are seriously screwed Secondly (or thirdly depending on how you count) We do not start counting at zero, and we never have. It took thousands of years after counting was invented for anyone to even invent the zero. (A tip of the hat to medieval Islamic scholars!) If you go to count your comics, your fingers, your apples, your oranges, your cows, the grains of sand on beach or the numbers of stars in the sky, the number of dates you've had or eaten, your grapes, your gripes, or anything else, you start at one, not zero, for obvious reasons. Do not embarrass yourself by mentioning zero degrees temperature. Temperature numbers are not quantitative, i.e. when it's 20 degrees you don't have twenty of anything.\n\tBased on facts I'm making up at this moment (I am not making that up) this has had other unfortunate effects, or collateral damage.  Wizard \ndoes the &quot;one-half issues which at least belong at the start of the numbers, being previews. I suppose they don't use zero because so often publishers want to do this. If  a publisher does a zero as the &quot;first&quot; issue,then it goes Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½, 0, 1. What kind of counting is that? And it gets worse. Marvel has published &quot;Negative One&quot; issues. Now that is whacked. In a further fit of numbering madness, marvel once published two comics with he same title, distinguished by one of them used roman numerals for it's volume number. I my head explodes.\n\tCritical Warning! - The point of brining this up!\n\tI strongly recommend you do not put Spider-man -1 on top of Spider-man 1. There's definitely a finite probability that after you do both will experience total conversion to energy, which would be bad. How bad? Not nearly as bad as I hoped when I wrote that, but still pretty bad. Except for the fact you would be dead, you'd be very sorry you did it, unless you are a soul-less unfeeling human monster like former US VP Cheney. Odds are he is not reading this. If your are, Mr. Vice President, you are a public figure so I can mock you all I want (Sticks out tongue and laugh nervously, which is very hard to do at the same time.)\n\tI've seen completely non-authoritative figures from 56-140g (c. 2-5oz) for a bagged and boarded comic book, so I'll just unjustifiably assume the two comics weigh 280g together, and that this weight is exactly the same as their mass, which actually (non imaginary fact alert) is more or less true as long as the weighing is done on earth, with some variance with geography. It turns out that the total annihilation of that amount of matter releases the same amount of energy a bomb of about 6 megatons, all in gamma radiation and neutrinos.  The Hiroshima bomb was 13 kilotons, so it's like 462 of those. (The effects would not be exactly the same as one of our atomic bombs, but I don't know in what ways) Sounds like a lot, and it will kill everyone in a good sized city, but not destroy the earth. \n\tSo you see in the end, by infallible reasoning, I have demonstrated that publishing zero issues of comics caused a chain of events that could result in the death of millions! You can rest assured that digital comics pose no such danger. The total mass of the atoms used to record them on your hard drive is very small. Still, you might want to keep your Marvel -1 and 1 issues in separate folders. \n\nSo uh, yeah Star Spangled War stories (that's the best kind). The comic changed names again to Become &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; at #205, running to #268 in 1982.\n\nStar Spangled War Stories v1 131-133, 003-204(i) (1952-1977)\nStar Spangled War Stories v2 001 ctc (2010)\n\n\n\n\nStar Trek\n\n     Da, da-da da-da da, Duh! Da da-da da, da, da, da, da-da-da-duh! Da-da da, duh, da-da DA, duh. DA!, DA!, DA!, da-da-duh!\n\n     That's from Star Trek the Motion Picture, The Next Generation Series and others Usually with shots of the Enterprise. It's hard to write music in letters. So no complaints. It sounds correct in my head. \n\n     Star Trek has been published by several companies. There are some Star Trek comics in this torrent (new or reprinted) published  in the US every year from 1967-2002 except for 1983. The DC-Wildstorm and Marel-Malibu periods even overlap, which surprises me. Then came the DC-IDW gap. 2002-2006 are trek-less, empty years, sofaik. \n\n\nStar Trek (DC\n     Star Trek Ashcan-TOS,TNG\n\n     Star Trek Movie Adaptations III-VII\n          Star Trek Movie
