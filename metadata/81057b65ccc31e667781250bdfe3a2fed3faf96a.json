From Athens, Georgia, comes the band Drive-By Truckers, who have southern soul quite literally in their blood. The six-piece are performing a tune or two from their new album The Big To Do.\n\nThe multi-talented Mos Def is also in the studio, to play a number from his incredible The Ecstatic album as well as possibly joining in with one of the other acts. Making her UK TV debut is Michigan-born Diane Birch, who has been causing a stir in the US with her album Bible Belt over the last few months. And jazz legend Bobby McFerrin performs a number from his new VOCAbuLarieS album.  \n\nGeneral \n \nComplete name : Later, Live With Jools Holland.s36eo3.divx \nFormat : AVI \nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave \nFile size : 310 MiB \nDuration : 28mn 50s \nOverall bit rate : 1 502 Kbps \n\nVideo \nID : 0 \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263) \nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream \nCodec ID : DX50 \nCodec ID/Hint : DivX 5 \nDuration : 28mn 50s \nBit rate : 1 301 Kbps \nWidth : 688 pixels \nHeight : 384 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate : 25.000 fps \nResolution : 8 bits \nColorimetry : 4:2:0 \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.197 \nStream size : 268 MiB (87%) \nTitle : Video  \nWriting library : DivX 6.8.2 (UTC 2008-05-17) \n\nAudio \nID : 1 \nFormat : AC-3 \nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3 \nCodec ID : 2000 \nDuration : 28mn 50s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 192 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nStream size : 39.6 MiB (13%) \nAlignment : Split accross interleaves \nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame) \nInterleave, preload duration : 500 ms \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81057b65ccc31e667781250bdfe3a2fed3faf96a","amp;dn":"Later%2C+Live+With+Jools+Holland+%28BBC2%2C+Gorillaz%2C+%2C+Bobby+McFerrin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81057b65ccc31e667781250bdfe3a2fed3faf96a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,5,123,101,204,195,30,102,119,129,37,11,223,227,162,254,211,250,249,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
