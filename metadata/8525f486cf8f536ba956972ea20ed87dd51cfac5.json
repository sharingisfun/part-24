For that last point, we consider flashback issues to be read a the point that the tale is being told, though issues that take place in the past are placed at that particular point in time.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8525f486cf8f536ba956972ea20ed87dd51cfac5","amp;dn":"Complete+Batman+Reading+Order-ComicsBackIssues-Part2+92-96+FIXED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8525f486cf8f536ba956972ea20ed87dd51cfac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,37,244,134,207,143,83,107,169,86,151,46,162,14,216,125,213,28,250,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
