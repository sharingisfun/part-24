You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n\n\nVirus scanner results\n\nAll virus scanner detection\\'s are a false-positive. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.\n\nMD5: e382b9155801214ca8938a438853be95\nSHA-1: 449eb5dd581e6f9f2b0da3d4c199d30e621cc478","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a09200a25ffd49576bc1a8ce772d948fd5cf9616","amp;dn":"Windows+Loader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a09200a25ffd49576bc1a8ce772d948fd5cf9616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,146,0,162,95,253,73,87,107,193,168,206,119,45,148,143,213,207,150,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
