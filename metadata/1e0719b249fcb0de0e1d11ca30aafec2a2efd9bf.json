Extreme arcade racing has never been so rough, as you'll have to kick, beat, punch, and maul your opponents with chains, clubs, sticks, and other brutal weaponry. Of course, your opponents can and will fight back sometimes going so far as to put you on a hit list for later group pummeling. Not only that, you've got to watch out for the fuzz! The cops are out in full force setting up road blocks, chasing you on motorcycles, and hauling you off to jail if you're unfortunate enough to take a spill in front an officer. Pick your racer (the gamut runs from punks to jocks), and then head off to Der Panzer Klub where you can talk to fellow riders, sign up for a race, or purchase a new ride. You can choose between rat bikes, sport bikes, and super bikes, but you'll need to win plenty of races to earn enough cash for an upgrade. The five 3D tracks include the City, the Peninsula, Pacific Coast Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Rev up for two-wheel brutality with ROAD RASH.\n\n\nROAD RASH 3D:\n\nThe ultimate combat motorcycle event returns this time in full 3D! With realistic road conditions and aggressive competition from other bikers, you're going to have your work cut out for you. Racing through panoramic vistas of intense 3D worlds, you'll feel each bump, dip, and harrowing turn. The game has three in-your-face modes: Time Trial, in which players battle computer racers for the best times; Thrash, an arcade-style trip through some amazing terrain; and the Big Game, which pits you against rival racing gangs for the championship. The brutal list of gangs includes the Desades, Dewleys, Kaffe Boys, and the Techgeists each with different bikes, weapons, and preferred race grounds. The individualized AI applied to each gang means that they'll have unique personalities and tactics, making your job all the more difficult. Each track features a different soundscape and the game even includes surround-sound effects to keep you abreast of where your opponents are via audio. ROAD RASH 3D is as cool as it gets without adding a fourth dimension.\n\n\nROAD RASH JAILBREAK:\n\nThe maniacal motorbike mayhem returns, and this time it's about revenge. Your buddy Spaz has been jailed, and it's up to you is to break him out. In order to do that, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have to join a motorcycle gang and move up through the organization by succeeding at challenges and winning races. If you'd rather, you can play on the square side of thing as a copper in Five-O mode, a cops-and-robbers chase. The game includes five multiplayer modes, including an awesome Sidecar mode, in which one player does the driving while the other does the shooting. This installment of ROAD RASH features 45 attack combos and Super Moves, plus 11 awesome weapons including nunchakus, mace, crowbars, and a cattle prod. There are over 80 miles of interconnected road in this 3D epic, meaning youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have to play for a long time to see everything there is to see. With more than 100 different races, the game is full of surprises around every corner. Enjoy the 15 new bikes, six types of sidecars, and the sweet new soundtrack of Road Rash: Jailbreak.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e0719b249fcb0de0e1d11ca30aafec2a2efd9bf","amp;dn":"%28PSX-PSP%29+Road+Rash+Collection+converted+properly+%28Kingdom-games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e0719b249fcb0de0e1d11ca30aafec2a2efd9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,7,25,178,73,252,176,222,14,29,17,202,48,170,254,194,162,239,217,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
