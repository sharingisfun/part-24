This version is 33 minutes and comes from the PAL Tartan box set.\n\nThere's very little about this film on the internet. Pasolini travels to India to make notes about a future film he planned on making. He examines differences between the modern India and the historical one found in its mythologies and vedic texts by posing a particular question based on a didactic anecdote that no longer seems to apply in a twentieth century world. This 'prehistory' forms most of the first part of the film. The second part covers a modern India marred by social divisions, overpopulation and poverty. Pasolini keeps his focus on the human tragedy involved at all times.\n\nFile Name .........................................: appunti.per.un.film.sull.india.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 471,525,376 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 33:00.080\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.304)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1759 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.229 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 133 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
