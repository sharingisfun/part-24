He only takes on his humanoid form when he wants a mate. However, the village men hate the water sprite and want him dead. All he wanted was some mates, due to his lonelyness....\n\nDespite the low-budget, \\&quot;Ele o Boto\\&quot; is a wonderfully done and haunting movie that will captivate myth and folklore buffs or people whom are into dolphins, water-sprites or merfolk like creatures. I don\\&amp;#039;t think CG and the big name companies at Hollywood or parts of Europe could not do something this interesting and effective.\n\nQualidade de VÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­deo: DVD Rip\nVÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­deo Codec: XViD\nVÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­deo Bitrate: 112 Kbps\nÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½udio Codec: MP3\nÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½udio Bitrate: 90\nResoluÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o: 512 x 384\nFormato de Tela: Tela Cheia (4x3)\nFrame Rate: 23.976 FPS\nTamanho: 714 Mb\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5746a3e9f6b3310aa7d4b2b4a76793e8588916ae","amp;dn":"Ele%2C+O+Boto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5746a3e9f6b3310aa7d4b2b4a76793e8588916ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,70,163,233,246,179,49,10,167,212,178,180,167,103,147,232,88,137,22,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
