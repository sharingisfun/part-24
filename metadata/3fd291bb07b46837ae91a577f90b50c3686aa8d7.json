At the end of the show, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore first attacked one of the network's video cameras (which had been getting between him and the audience) with his guitar, and then had his amplifiers doused with gasoline and set on fire, which caused an explosion. \n\n01 &quot;Burn&quot; - 6:21 \n02 &quot;Might Just Take Your Life&quot; - 4:41 \n03 &quot;Mistreated&quot; (Coverdale, Blackmore) - 10:13 \n04 &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; (Ian Gillan, Blackmore, Roger Glover, Lord, Paice) - 8:26 \n05 &quot;You Fool No One&quot; - 18:42 \n06 a) &quot;The Mule&quot; (Gillan, Blackmore, Glover, Lord, Paice)\n   b) &quot;Space Truckin'&quot; (Gillan, Blackmore, Glover, Lord, Paice) - 25:13 \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeep Purple's performance at the California Jam has been available over the years in several different releases with various names, among them: &quot;California Jamming&quot;, &quot;Live at the Ontario Speedway '74&quot;, &quot;Live at the California Jam&quot; and finally &quot;California Jam 1974&quot; (not counting successive re-releases, mostly Japanese). While all of theses releases are culled from the same performance, most of them don't feature the full show, with edits and most importantly, missing a full song: &quot;Lay Down, Stay Down.&quot;\n\nWhile the successive re-releases have attempted to improve the sound quality (which was poor on the earliest ones), the show itself suffered from technical failures, making it impossible to fully correct them, a fact most notably evident during opening number &quot;Burn&quot;, where the guitar is barely audible and then gradually gains volume.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid Coverdale - lead vocals \nRitchie Blackmore - guitar \nGlenn Hughes - bass, backing vocals \nJon Lord - organ, synthesizer, backing vocals \nIan Paice - drums \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fd291bb07b46837ae91a577f90b50c3686aa8d7","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+%5C%27Live+At+The+California+Jam%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fd291bb07b46837ae91a577f90b50c3686aa8d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,210,145,187,7,180,104,55,174,145,165,119,249,11,80,195,104,106,168,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
