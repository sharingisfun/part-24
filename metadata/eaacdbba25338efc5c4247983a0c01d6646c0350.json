It is, and we ignore this message at our peril.&quot;-Elizabeth Kolbert\n\n&quot;Brilliantly reported andwritten with brutal clarity.&quot;-Huffington Post\n\nMerchants of Doubt was one of the most talked-about climate change books of recent years, for reasons easy to understand: It tells the controversialstory of how a loose-knit group of high-level scientists and scientific advisers, with deep connections in politics and industry, ran effective campaigns to mislead the public and deny well-established scientific knowledge over four decades.
