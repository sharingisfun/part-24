The book focuses on BarbaraÃ¢â‚¬â€œ the traumatized blonde of the 1968 originalÃ¢â‚¬â€œ who has come full circle since her initial night with the living dead, now toting firearms and sporting tank-tops in a way not seen since Ellen Ripley of the Aliens films. An encounter with a bizarre scientist sends Barbara and her gang on a search for the origin of the flesh-eating undead, only to discover this horror is only the beginning of the extinction of mankind!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7936129a10003065b989a2503196230a88297b2d","amp;dn":"Night+of+the+Living+Dead+-+Barbara%27s+Zombie+Chronicles+%5BComplete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7936129a10003065b989a2503196230a88297b2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,54,18,154,16,0,48,101,185,137,162,80,49,150,35,10,136,41,123,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
