Because the emphasis is on ballads and not all of the songs are that well suited to Fitzgerald's musical personality (particularly &quot;Lush Life&quot; and &quot;I Want to Talk About You&quot;), this set is only a mixed success. Much more successful are &quot;Don't Be That Way&quot; and &quot;A Foggy Day&quot; but this is not one of the more essential Ella Fitzgerald records.
