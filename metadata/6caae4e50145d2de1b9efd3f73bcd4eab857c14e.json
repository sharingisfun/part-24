Though the book is thick, dense, and unfriendly to careless readers, it is indispensable to those interested in the philosophy of consciousness and free will. Some of his arguments are fallacious, others are unclear, but for the most part SartreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thoughts penetrate deeply into fundamental philosophical territory. Basing his conception of self-consciousness loosely on HeideggerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbeing,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Sartre proceeds to sharply delineate between conscious actions (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfor themselvesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and unconscious (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin themselvesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). It is a conscious choice, he claims, to live oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œauthenticallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and in a unified fashion, or notÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½this is the fundamental freedom of our lives.\n\nDrawing on history and his own rich imagination for examples, Sartre offers compelling supplements to his more formal arguments. The waiter who detaches himself from his job-role sticks in the readerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s memory with greater tenacity than the lengthy discussion of inauthentic life and serves to bring the full force of the argument to life. Even if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not an angst-addicted poet from North Beach, Being and Nothingness offers you a deep conversation with a brilliant mindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½unfortunately, a rare find these days.
