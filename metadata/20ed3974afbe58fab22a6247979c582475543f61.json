In Cabela's Dangerous \nHunts 2009, you will face raw danger as you encounter the fiercest animals on \nearth, including lions, grizzly bears, jaguars and more. Accurately modeled \nCabelaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯s equipment in the game means the firearms, tactics and gear are all \nrealistic and precise - but this wonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯t always help in the face of an \nunpredictable, open environment packed with avalanches, elephant stampedes, and \npiranha infested waters. If you do miss a shot and fail to stop a charging \nman-eating animal, you will be forced to fight it via a melee defense - but pay \nattention; it's likely another nearby animal will join the attack.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20ed3974afbe58fab22a6247979c582475543f61","amp;dn":"Cabelas_Dangerous_Hunts_2009_USA_PS2DVD-ZRY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20ed3974afbe58fab22a6247979c582475543f61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,237,57,116,175,190,88,250,178,42,98,71,151,156,88,36,117,84,63,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
