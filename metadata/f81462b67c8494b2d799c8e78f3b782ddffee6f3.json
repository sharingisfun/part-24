Formed in the Stafford area, Bizarre Inc. made an immediate impact with its 1991 debut single &quot;Playing with Knives,&quot; a massive club hit which topped the UK dance charts; &quot;X-Static,&quot; &quot;Plutonic&quot; and &quot;Raise Me&quot; followed prior to the release of their 1992 debut LP Energique. A subsequent single, &quot;I'm Gonna Get You, &quot; hit the American pop charts in 1993, but Bizarre Inc. then disappeared from the club scene for several years, causing barely a ripple upon resurfacing in 1996 with Surprise and in 1999 with the single Playing with Knives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f81462b67c8494b2d799c8e78f3b782ddffee6f3","amp;dn":"Bizarre+Inc+-+Surprise+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f81462b67c8494b2d799c8e78f3b782ddffee6f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,20,98,182,124,132,148,178,215,153,200,231,143,59,120,45,223,254,230,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
