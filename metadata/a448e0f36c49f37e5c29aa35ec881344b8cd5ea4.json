But when he begrudgingly allows naive Mississippi runaway Melodie St. Ann Celestine to live in his apartment, his reclusive rages give way to an unlikely friendship and Boris begins to mold the impressionable young girl's worldly views to match his own. When it comes to love, &quot;whatever works&quot; is his motto, but his already perplexed life complicates itself further when Melodie's parents eventually track her down.\n\n309 MB (303 MB), time 1:31:39, RMF\nVideo : 261 MB, 399 Kbps, 23.0 fps, 624*352 (16:9),  RV40 = RealVideo 9\nAudio : 42 MB, 64 Kbps, 44100 Hz, 2 channels , 0x0 = RealAudio 8,cook-24 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a448e0f36c49f37e5c29aa35ec881344b8cd5ea4","amp;dn":"Whatever+Works+%2A2009%2A+%5BDVDRip%5D+%5BRMVB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a448e0f36c49f37e5c29aa35ec881344b8cd5ea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,72,224,243,108,73,243,126,92,41,170,53,236,136,19,68,184,205,94,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
