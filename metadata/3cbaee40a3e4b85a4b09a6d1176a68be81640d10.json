Veteran CIA operative Marty tells Miller that there are no weapons,it is a deception to allow the Americans to take over the country and install a puppet leader. Marty correctly anticipates that,despite Bush's gung-ho assurances, the policy is doomed to failure. Also suspicious of Poundsgate is Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne,who lets slip to Miller that Poundsgate told her he had secret talks in Jordan with an important Iraqi,code-named Magellan,who told him about the weapons, though it now seems likely Magellan's true information was to the contrary. Miller deduces that Magellan is General Al Rawi, a close supporter of the deposed Saddam Hussain and, accompanied by his interpreter, Freddy, a decent Iraqi who only wants stability for his country, sets out to track down Al Rawi. However, Poundsgate's men are also on Al Rawi's trail,to stop him from talking. After an explosive showdown Miller emails Lawrie to tell her that there never were any weapons,relying on her and other journalists to inform the world of Bush's deception","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cbaee40a3e4b85a4b09a6d1176a68be81640d10","amp;dn":"Green.Zone%5B2010%5DDvDrip-aXXo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cbaee40a3e4b85a4b09a6d1176a68be81640d10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,186,238,64,163,228,184,90,75,9,166,209,23,106,104,190,129,100,13,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
