It presents discrete-signal processing concepts from the perspective of an experienced electronics or radio engineer, which is especially meaningful for practicing engineers, technicians, and students. The approach is almost entirely mathematical, but at a level that is suitable for undergraduate curriculums and also for independent, at-home study using a personal computer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86162a6082c27e4f2ba14239922ef19ef7d50970","amp;dn":"Discrete-Signal+Analysis+and+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86162a6082c27e4f2ba14239922ef19ef7d50970","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,22,42,96,130,194,126,79,43,161,66,57,146,46,241,158,247,213,9,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
