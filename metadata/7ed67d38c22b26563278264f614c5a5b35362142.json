Kurosh. \n\n Higher algebra - the subject of this text - is a far-reaching and\n natural generalization of the basic school course of elementary\n algebra. Central to elementary algebra is without doubt the problem\n of solving equations. The study of equations begins with the very\n simple case of one equation of the first degree in one unknown. From\n there on, the development proceeds in two directions: to systems of\n two and three equations of the first degree in two and, respectively,\n three unknowns, and to a single quadratic equation in one unknown and\n also to a few special types of higher-degree equations which readily\n reduce to quadratic equations (quartic equations, for example). Both\n trends are further developed in the course of higher algebra, thus\n determining its two large areas of study. One - the foundations of\n linear algebra - starts with the study of arbitrary systems of\n equations of the first degree (linear equations). When the number of\n equations equals the number of unknowns, solutions of such systems\n are obtained by means of the theory of determinants. \n \n  This book was translated from the Russian by George Yankovsky. The\n  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1972, with reprints in\n  1975, 1980 and 1984. The book below is from the 1984 reprint.\n\n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  DJVU | OCR | 15.8 MB | Pages: 432 |  \n\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction 7\nChapter 1.\nSystems of linear equations.
