This time, the ancient Egyptian tablet (the one that brings all the exhibits at New York's Museum of Natural History to life at night) is being shipped off to the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.--which, as the movie diligently tells us, is the largest museum in the world. Naturally, former museum guard Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) heads down to rescue it (and, by extension, keep his magical museum friends alive). He ends up fighting with a nasty pharaoh who talks like Boris Karloff (Hank Azaria, The Simpsons) and falling in love with Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams, Enchanted). All the old gang are along for the ride, including Dexter the monkey; much face-slapping and special effects ensue. There aren't many surprises, but Battle of the Smithsonian is cheerful enough to entertain everyone who enjoyed the first movie. The great supporting cast from the first movie returns, including Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, and Robin Williams\n\normat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 1.57 GiB\nDuration : 1h 40mn\nOverall bit rate : 2 235 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP : No\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\n\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 40mn\nBit rate : 1 776 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 436 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.35:1\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.226\nStream size : 1.25 GiB (79%)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ced4565c807696d2d5bd1dfd769eaa6a4133406d","amp;dn":"Night+At+The+Museum+2%5B2009%5Dac3+5.1-winker%40TFRG-1337X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ced4565c807696d2d5bd1dfd769eaa6a4133406d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,212,86,92,128,118,150,210,213,189,29,253,118,158,170,106,65,51,64,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
