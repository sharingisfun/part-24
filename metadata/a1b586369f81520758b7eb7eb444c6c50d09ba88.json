Its waters are a graveyard for countless wrecked ships. Its lore is full of tales about treachery and murder. And it was once the haunt of pirates. Haunt, indeed!\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador has tales of the supernatural that date back centuries, to a time before Canada even existed as a nation. Here the ghosts not only lurk in old houses and forlorn cemeteries, they come up out of the sea to walk the decks of ships before the eyes of terrified crewmen. They lament out on the ice where seventy-seven men perished in the Newfoundland Sealing Disaster of 1914. And in St. Johns the courthouse is said to be haunted by the ghost of Catherine Snow, who was hanged in 1834 for the murder of her husband.\n\nHere we find tales, both personal and historical, of ghostly haunting and unexplained happenings; from the Old Hag to headless ghosts.
