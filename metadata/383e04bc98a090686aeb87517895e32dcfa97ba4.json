Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\n\nGuests: Mike Ward, Luis J. Gomez\n\n\nEpisode 225: TACS is back from vacation and Ant begins the show by recapping his Labor Day party, the unwanted guests, and squashing any leftover beef with Artie Lange. He then talks about the latest with Kim Davis, denying human beings of their rights, the West Indian Day parade shooting, Robert De Niro jumping the shark, and goes through some movies he watched over the break. Mike Ward and Louis J. Gomez join the show to discuss social media links, MikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new special, Googling yourself and reactions, Nicole Arbour and fat shaming, posting Ã¢â‚¬Å“offensiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ jokes on-line, and playing devilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advocate. We then get into a Ã¢â‚¬Å“fat fuck breakÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by watching a rebuttal video to Nicole Arbour, talking about being naturally fat, reasons for obesity, fat discrimination, carb shaming, weight differences by country, fat kids, and eating from the earth. The boys chat about pubes, jean cuts, plastic bag bathing suits, grooming the hair down there, childhood shenanigans, getting and having licenses, and being smooth with a PBA card. Ant reminisces about judges, bars, and driving with his dad, Mike talks about school discipline, and they wrap the day with some political talk that includes Bernie Sanders, Hillary, Trump, Bush, and breaking down presidential power.\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:383e04bc98a090686aeb87517895e32dcfa97ba4","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-09-08+Mike+Ward+Luis+J+Gomez+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"383e04bc98a090686aeb87517895e32dcfa97ba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,62,4,188,152,160,144,104,106,235,135,81,120,149,227,45,207,169,123,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
