As an international photojournalist, she's used to violence in war zones, but she's shocked when it erupts in the sleepy hamlet on the north coast of New South Wales, threatening all she holds dear.\n\nBattle-weary Nicholas Lawson walked away from his military career leaving unfinished business. In a coastal backwater, that decision returns to haunt him. He remembers all too vividly his last lethal assignment in Afghanistan when Ellie's sister, Nina, was shot and killed. Ellie's been in his dreams ever since, even if she doesn't remember him . . .\n\nAs a storm rages and floodwaters rise, Ellie struggles to save her community. But who can she trust? Nick Lawson, the dangerously attractive stranger with secrets, or an old friend who's never let her down?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:759462e1976abced6787631ed62b150c52085672","amp;dn":"Half+Moon+Bay+-+Helene+Young","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"759462e1976abced6787631ed62b150c52085672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,148,98,225,151,106,188,237,103,135,99,30,214,43,21,12,82,8,86,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
