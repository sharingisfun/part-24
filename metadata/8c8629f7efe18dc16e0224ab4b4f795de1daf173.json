The music is all very pretty, the songs are professionally constructed, the performances are all tight and efficiently edited, and the entire construction lacks soul of any kind, never mind collective. Aside from the coldly pop nature of the album, there is the duet with Elton John ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for which the mix is inexplicably softened to something approaching the mushy end of AOR, which is very much the place that people saw John inhabiting through 1999-2000. The end result is hardly distinctive enough to be of interest. Another element of confusion comes with the image that Ed Roland and the band have chosen to pursue this time around ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ namely, the presentation is straight out of the Y2K boy band image catalog. It becomes seriously mind warping when looking at the interior artwork, where it's obvious that this bunch hasn't been beardless boys for some time. One has to wonder where they thought their market was for this release.\n\n01 Skin                   Roland     3:09\n02 Vent                   Rolland    3:14\n03 Why, Pt. 2             Roland     3:38\n04 10 Years Later         Roland     3:46\n05 Boast                  Roland     3:40\n06 Turn                   Roland     3:38\n07 You Speak My Language  Sandman    3:24\n08 Perfect Day            Roland     3:48\n09 After All              Roland     3:44\n10 Over Tokyo             Roland     3:37\n11 Happiness              Roland     3:31","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c8629f7efe18dc16e0224ab4b4f795de1daf173","amp;dn":"Collective+Soul+-+2000+-+Blender++%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c8629f7efe18dc16e0224ab4b4f795de1daf173","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,134,41,247,239,225,141,193,110,2,36,171,75,79,121,93,225,218,241,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
