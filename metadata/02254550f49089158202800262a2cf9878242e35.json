By focusing on the individual, rather than the organization, she defines a powerful focus for bias busting in the workplace. Racial and sexual bias costs big bucks warns Thiederman, citing litigation, lowered sales, and loss of employees and customers. Using case studies, politically incorrect questions, and insightful strategies, she guides readers through &quot;the discomfort of self discovery.&quot;\nAfter detailing how biases are learned, Thiederman introduces seven steps to prevent bias from blocking and distorting your work relationships. The book's centerpiece is a brilliant discussion of how to manage &quot;gateway events,&quot;(for example, hearing an inappropriate comment or being treated with a biased behavior) and start a conversation about sticky diversity issues. This brave and groundbreaking analysis should define the direction of diversity training for decades to come. --Barbara Mackoff","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02254550f49089158202800262a2cf9878242e35","amp;dn":"Making+Diversity+Work%3A+7+Steps+for+Defeating+Bias+in+the+Workpla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02254550f49089158202800262a2cf9878242e35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,37,69,80,244,144,137,21,130,2,128,2,98,162,207,152,120,36,46,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
