M. Stirling, Sharon Kay Penman, and many others.\n\nWrites Gardner Dozois in his Introduction, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find no hapless victims who stand by whimpering in dread while the male hero fights the monster or clashes swords with the villain, and if you want to tie these women to the railroad tracks, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find you have a real fight on your hands.  Instead, you will find sword-wielding women warriors, intrepid women fighter pilots and far-ranging spacewomen, deadly female serial killers, formidable female superheroes, sly and seductive femmes fatale, female wizards, hard-living Bad Girls, female bandits and rebels, embattled survivors in Post-Apocalyptic futures, female Private Investigators, stern female hanging judges, haughty queens who rule nations and whose jealousies and ambitions send thousands to grisly deaths, daring dragonriders, and many more.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57cccbc06ff6d8e4aa859ad0237480123f4b1da6","amp;dn":"Dangerous+Women+-+George+R.+R.+Martin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57cccbc06ff6d8e4aa859ad0237480123f4b1da6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,204,203,192,111,246,216,228,170,133,154,208,35,116,128,18,63,75,29,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
