Along the way, AugiÃƒÂ©ras begins to develop his talents as a painter of evocative charcoal images that will result in his creation of an underground desert &quot;Sistine Chapel,&quot; which will be the subject of intense speculation among a group of researchers and admirers years later. Miquel BarcelÃƒÂ³, one of Spain's leading contemporary artists, can be seen throughout the film as the man to finally discover AugiÃƒÂ©ras's lost work, which he goes about resurrecting from the significant damage wrought upon it by time and termites.\n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Los Pasos Dobles (2011).mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 466 Kbps\nLength            : 1.49 GiB for 1h 26mn 24s 920ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 000 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 576 (1.778) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : ca\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #3           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2007421/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2007421/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Bambara, French\nSubtitles: Spanish, Catalan, English, French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b40ac1939ffc9d5b08452051a8a06d002e9599e9","amp;dn":"Los+Pasos+Dobles+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b40ac1939ffc9d5b08452051a8a06d002e9599e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,10,193,147,159,252,157,91,8,69,32,81,168,160,109,0,46,149,153,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
