The CD was recorded over several nights during the band's &quot;Educated Horses&quot; tour and was said to include a 36-page super-deluxe book of never-before-seen live pictures and a DVD of live footage and animated videos. After the release of the album no artbook or DVD were included with the release of the album. Blabbermouth.net reported that the DVD companion would be available in spring 2008, but to the disappointment of fans, as of 2013, it has not surfaced. This album was also the first album to be released in the new Recyclable CD cases.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Sawdust in the Blood&quot;   \t1:40\n02. \t&quot;American Witch&quot;   \t4:01\n03. \t&quot;Demon Speeding&quot;   \t3:33\n04. \t&quot;Living Dead Girl&quot;   \t3:25\n05. \t&quot;More Human than Human&quot;   \t4:23\n06. \t&quot;Dead Girl Superstar&quot;   \t3:12\n07. \t&quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;   \t4:29\n08. \t&quot;Let It All Bleed Out&quot;   \t4:08\n09. \t&quot;Creature of the Wheel&quot;   \t3:36\n10. \t&quot;Demonoid Phenomenon&quot;   \t4:18\n11. \t&quot;Super-Charger Heaven&quot;   \t3:29\n12. \t&quot;Never Gonna Stop (The Red, Red Kroovy)&quot;   \t3:06\n13. \t&quot;Black Sunshine&quot;   \t3:53\n14. \t&quot;Superbeast&quot;   \t4:54\n15. \t&quot;The Devil's Rejects&quot;   \t3:59\n16. \t&quot;The Lords of Salem&quot;   \t4:19\n17. \t&quot;Thunder Kiss '65&quot;   \t5:19\n18. \t&quot;Dragula&quot;   \t5:16\n\n\n    Rob Zombie Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals\n    John 5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar\n    Piggy D.
