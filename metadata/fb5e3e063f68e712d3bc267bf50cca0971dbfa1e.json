Teamed \n\nwith a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) \n\nand a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott), TV \n\nweatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to \n\nPunxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual \n\nGroundhog Day festivities. But on his way out of town, \n\nPhil is caught in a giant blizzard, which he failed to \n\npredict, and finds himself stuck in small-town hell. Just \n\nwhen things couldn't get worse, they get worse; Phil \n\nwakes the next morning to find it's Groundhog Day all \n\noveragain... and again... and again.\n\n  Starring: Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, \n\nStephen Tobolowsky, Brian Doyle-Murray.\n\n  Directed by: Harold Ramis.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 37min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 448","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb5e3e063f68e712d3bc267bf50cca0971dbfa1e","amp;dn":"Groundhog+Day+%281993%29+%28Bill+Murray%2C+Andie+MacDowell%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb5e3e063f68e712d3bc267bf50cca0971dbfa1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,94,62,6,63,104,231,18,211,188,38,123,245,12,202,9,113,219,250,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
