Most of the members record and tour with their respective main bands, considering Feared Ã¢â‚¬Å“an ongoing experiment.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With this release, however, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve proven that the band is much more than an experiment.\n\nShowing tremendous growth and maturity in the mere months that have passed since the highly-praised Furor Incarnatus, Feared plays death-groove metal with subtle hints of black metal Ã¢â‚¬â€ pure brutality throughout.\n\nThe introductory track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sun Awake,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a doom-style dirge complete with death knell and eerie texturing. It made me feel like I was caught in the middle of a snowstorm when the beast on the album cover appears. With a sudden explosion of speed, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Needle EffectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rips your face off, then slides into a great speed goove. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Your GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is just as exhilarating, working in a melodic chorus reminiscent of Fear Factory.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Hate Is EverythingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sports a great main riff that again lays down into a thick groove. TalleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful drums are in the spotlight in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mass Destruction,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tearing through EnglundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crushing riffs. The chorus of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ErasedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ once again recalls Fear FactoryÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs melodic side, layering synthesizers and samples in a way that never takes away from the dark heaviness. Urgency and dread envelope you in Ã¢â‚¬Å“HuldraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Invidia,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ then steamroll it all with the ferocity of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mylingen.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRelief from the assault comes from doom-laden Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Shadow World,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a transition song Ã¢â‚¬â€ the beginning of the third act, if you will. While a change of pace, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still quite heavy and powerful on its own. The ambient, ethereal tones of Ã¢â‚¬Å“VinterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are a beautiful contrast to the rest of the album Ã¢â‚¬â€ a perfect closing instrumental.\n\nViolent and menacing, Vinter rarely lets up. As intense as the album is, Feared also frequently strikes memorable power grooves. The basis of it all is the brilliant axework of band founder Ola Englund (of The Haunted and Six Feet Under) and drummer Kevin Talley (of Battlecross). The chemistry between them shines on every track, tight and fierce.\n\nVocalist Mario Ramos (of Demonoid) does what only heavyweights like Fear FactoryÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs Burton C. Bell can do Ã¢â‚¬â€ alternate between fierce death metal screams and solid melodic progressions. And what power is behind RamosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice Ã¢â‚¬â€ think about adding David Vincent (Morbid Angel) and Corpsegrinder (Cannibal Corpse) together.\n\nThe newest addition the the band, bassist Jocke Skog, also boasts a production credit on the album. Honestly, the bass was my only disappointment with the album, as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very low in the mix and mostly unnoticeable. EnglundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s massive guitar tone makes up for this lack, but interesting basswork is not part of the songwriting.\n\nWhat a great journey Vinter is. Songwriting and structure are fully developed, interesting and unpredictable. Each song takes you on a ride, which also characterizes the album as a whole. The quality of the production is fantastic Ã¢â‚¬â€ clean and not overdriven.\n\nI shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have expected anything but greatness from Feared. Hard work, talent and passion make this band special, and Vinter emanates this mature culmination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f964d453001b5bbc39cd8829da3bca99ffabb3b6","amp;dn":"Feared+-+Vinter+%28320CBR%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f964d453001b5bbc39cd8829da3bca99ffabb3b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,100,212,83,0,27,91,188,57,205,136,41,218,59,202,153,255,171,179,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
