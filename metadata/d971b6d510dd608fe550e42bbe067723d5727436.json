Troops are hopelessly outnumbered. \nBut even in defeat there is victory. The defenders of the Philippines - \nincluding PT-boat skippers John Brickley (Robert Montgomery) and \nRusty Ryan (John Wayne) - will give the U.S. war effort time to \nregroup after the devastation of Pearl Harbor.\n\nDirector John Ford&amp;#039;s World War II tale knows its battle-scarred \ntopic firsthand. Montgomery was himself a Pacific PT-boat commander \nand a valorous Bronze Star recipient. Ford filmed the Academy \nAwardÃ‚Â«-winning documentary Battle of Midway. And Wayne creates \na portrait of patriotic resolve as only he can. They Were Expendable \nsalutes all who expended themselves during some of the war&amp;#039;s bleakest hours. \n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n?
