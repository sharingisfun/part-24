It is hosted by Robert Carradine and Curtis Armstrong, both actors from the Revenge of the Nerds films.\n\nThe series follows eleven contestants as they complete various tasks in order to win the grand prize of $100,000 and to be &quot;crowned the greatest nerd&quot; of them all,[2] worthy to sit on &quot;the Throne of Games&quot;\n\nThe show uses a progressive elimination of the contestants. Following the first week, the contestants were separated into two teams chosen via schoolyard pick. The teams compete in a Nerd War, an event that requires them to work together to prepare for the main demonstration. Judges select which team is the better team; members on this team are safe from elimination. On the losing team, two players are selected for a Nerd Off; one is selected by a secret vote on the losing team, and the other from a similar vote from the winning team. The two selected players are told what the concept is behind the nerd-off, giving them a few hours to prepare by talking to anyone else still remaining in the game. At the event, the losing player is eliminated from the game.\n \n\nSize: 403 MiB\nRuntime: 41mn 20s\nFrameRate: 23.976\nBitRate: 1 237 Kbps\nResolution: 720 x 404\nAudio: 2 ch\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tvrage.com/shows/id-31168&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tvrage.com/shows/id-31168&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGREETS: EVOLVE\n\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN DONE DOWNLOADING!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac2f425443c8fbff20d1146e6ce21523017a93dd","amp;dn":"King.of.the.Nerds.S01E07.HDTV.x264-EVOLVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac2f425443c8fbff20d1146e6ce21523017a93dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,47,66,84,67,200,251,255,32,209,20,110,108,226,21,35,1,122,147,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
