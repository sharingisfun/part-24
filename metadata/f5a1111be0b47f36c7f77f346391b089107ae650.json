My other torrents can be seen here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/loninappleton&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/loninappleton&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt is a an edited selection of the only remaining available source for music originally found on an LP called &quot;Shakespeare and All That Jazz.&quot;\n\nHere are the selections from the newer CD called Ã¢â‚¬Å“WordsongsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which reference the plays and Sonnets of Shakespeare as performed by Cleo Laine and composed and conducted by John Dankworth.\n\nThough these may seem quaint or inappropriate or even profane treatments of the songs in Shakespeare,  the melodies stand by themselves as an introduction for those not acquainted with Shakespeare.  These songs come from 1963 in their original form.  It is these songs that were my real introduction to Shakespeare as a boy and were played on the statewide radio network.  \n\nMy best friend's mother was a teacher of English.  I shared the recording with her and put it on audiotape at her request for use in the classroom.  After that I do not know what influence that small act had on her students.  \n\nListen here for yourself to these catchy, swinging and also ballad melodies and find out how they could be used today.  Like the torrents given from the Globe Theatre these &quot;tunes&quot; are for an audience who may not know Shakespearean language directly.  The CD called &quot;Wordsongs&quot; appeared many years after the album on Fontana records because people like myself carried them in our memories.\n\nCleo Laine and John Dankworth are both knighted for their contributions to British culture.  But they are not knighted as a couple.  Dankworth is an English jazz musician and band leader.  He has done composition not only on themes of Shakespeare but also Dickens, the signs of the Zodiac and fine art painting.  Dankworth can be seen in the end credits of the television version of Beyond the Fringe.\n\nTheir individual accomplishments in music are wide-ranging and the work continues at a retreat called The Stables where music camps and performances are held.
