The study then moves beyond that stereotype to detail the reality of the personal and artistic lives of women on the French stage, from the almost unknown Marie FerrÃƒÂ© - who signed a contract for 12 livres a year in 1545 to perform the 'antiquailles de Rome or other histories, moralities, farces, and acrobatics' in the provinces - to the queens of the eighteenth-century Paris stage, whose 'adventures' have overshadowed their artistic triumphs. The book also investigates the ways in which actresses made invaluable contributions to the development of the French theatre in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and looks at the 'afterlives' of such women as Armande BÃƒÂ©jart, Marquise Du Parc, Charlotte Desmares, Adrienne Lecouvreur, and Hippolyte Clairon in biographies, plays, and films.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;In this lively and engaging study, Virginia Scott examines the careers of actresses in France from the late sixteenth to the early eighteenth centuries, placing them firmly in their social and artistic context. Refreshingly, she eschews anecdotal evidence, thereby providing us, perhaps for the first time, with an unbiased and even- handed account of her subjects' lives and work, but which nonetheless explores the fascination these first celebrities have exercised on audiences and critics both then and since.&quot;-Professor Jan Clarke, Durham University\n\n&quot;This engaging volume is highly recommended for scholars interested in women's history in the early modern period.&quot;-SHARON DIANE NELL,Loyola University Maryland\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description II\nHow did women become stars of the French stage in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries?
