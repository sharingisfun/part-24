The reason being that this conversion is particularly difficult to do effectively (on a case-by-case basis), so I think it best to have this done by someone who's had some luck in this endeavor (myself) rather than forcing the rest of the world to have to (painfully) go through the hundreds of failed experiments (per DVD) independently! So ...\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor this encoding (each one will be slightly different) bottom fields were discarded and the video was resized using the Lanzcoz3 method in two successive steps following cropping of top and bottom boundaries and a partial cropping of the sides (I have found that a better result is obtained if some of the side boundaries are retained).\n\nThe first step resized the video to 480p while maintaining the aspect ratio of the inner image (not the frame) and then once again to 720p at fixed AR.\n\nHence the aspect ratio of the internal image is precisely 4:3 even though the video frame itself has an AR of about 1.44444.\n\nAfter completing the (very speedy) conversion to XviD (bitrates being taken from first-pass results), the 15 minute pieces were combined using &quot;direct stream copy&quot; and ONLY then was the PCM audio converted to AC-3. This conversion was done using avidemux's LAV AC-3 encoder with a bitrate of 448 kbps and sampling frequency 48.0 KHz. As well, the Dolby Pro Logic II algorithm was employed during the audio conversion. \n\nNothing else was applied.\n\nSo, in effect, this is a &quot;partial demux&quot; of the original .VOB sequence (ie. with the odd fields being interpolated from the evens) and effectively a near-lossless reproduction of the original content in the form of a progressive AVI scan at 720p.\n\nVideo details as follows:\n-------------------------\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : DVD4.avi\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                           : OpenDML\nFile size                                : 4.10 GiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 57mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 5 011 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 2\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 1h 57mn\nBit rate                                 : 4 554 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 040 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.444\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.203\nStream size                              : 3.73 GiB (91%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 64\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 3s 920ms\nSource duration                          : 1h 57mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 375 MiB (9%)\nAlignment                                : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 32 ms (0.96 video frame)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59553e5f994c38fb12ad1e892f91d459c0b0d8cd","amp;dn":"GLENN+GOULD+ON+TELEVISION+-+THE+COMPLETE+CBC+BROADCASTS+1954-197","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59553e5f994c38fb12ad1e892f91d459c0b0d8cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,85,62,95,153,76,56,251,18,173,30,137,47,145,212,89,192,176,216,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
