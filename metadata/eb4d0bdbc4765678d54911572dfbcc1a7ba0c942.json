By denying this inheritance we are in danger of destroying everything we have strived so hard to create.\n    \nDespite the different skin colours, beliefs and rituals to be found in the 5000 million human beings alive today, we actually all share an almost identical genetic heritage. In this portrait of the human species, Desmond Morris takes us right to the centre of human existence and explores all aspects of human life and behaviour. From the way we rear our young to the common use of certain facial gestures, he covers a fascinating variety of subjects: how our hunting instincts have been channelled into an extraordinary range of sporting activities; how the modern art world can trace its roots back to an early primate picking up a stone resembling a face; how different courtship rituals across the world reflect the universal emotion of love.\n    \nDesmond Morris also looks at some of the damaging consequences that can be seen when we try to deny our animal heritage: how territorial fights erupt when the tribal systems within our overcrowded cities break down, and how human relationships disintegrate when natural social or sexual patterns change.\n    \nBoth candid and entertaining, Desmond Morris exposes our foibles, celebrates our triumphs and gives us a new understanding of the way we behave. A world-renowned zoologist, he has already fundamentally changed the way we perceive ourselves. Now The Human Animal takes us one step closer to confronting our true identity.\n\n\nThe Language of the Body\nThe BBC\\&amp;#039;s Natural History Unit focuses on the planet\\&amp;#039;s most advanced animal, beginning with a look at how man communicated before the evolution of language. Some gestures and expressions are so ingrained that we have not been able to erase them from our vocabulary.\n\n\nI serien fÃƒÂ¥r man alltsÃƒÂ¥ en biologs perspektiv pÃƒÂ¥ mÃƒÂ¤nniskan. Dvs se mÃƒÂ¤nniskan som det djur hon ju faktiskt ÃƒÂ¤r.\nSerien har gÃƒÂ¥tt pÃƒÂ¥ svensk TV en gÃƒÂ¥ng fÃƒÂ¶rut och jag satt som fÃƒÂ¶rtrollad och tittade. LÃƒÂ¤gger upp en del pÃƒÂ¥ prov fÃƒÂ¶r att se om det tar fart och finns intresse.\n\nFilen har tvÃƒÂ¥ audiospÃƒÂ¥r. Ett spanskt som ÃƒÂ¤r default tyvÃƒÂ¤rr. Men ocksÃƒÂ¥ ett engelskt. FÃƒÂ¥s lÃƒÂ¤tt fram i spelaren VLC genom att ÃƒÂ¤ndra audiospÃƒÂ¥r.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb4d0bdbc4765678d54911572dfbcc1a7ba0c942","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Human+Animal+1+of+6+Desmond+Morris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb4d0bdbc4765678d54911572dfbcc1a7ba0c942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,77,11,219,196,118,86,120,213,73,17,87,45,251,204,26,123,160,201,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
