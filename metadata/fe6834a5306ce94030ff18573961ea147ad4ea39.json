They spend long relentless days cutting summer hay and feeding it to their cattle through fierce Wyoming winters. The family bears witness to the cycle of life, bringing foals into the world and deciding when to let a favored mare pass on to the next. As Luke grows older, falls in love, and begins to assert his independence, Spencer strives to impart the wisdom of this way of life to his headstrong son, whatever the cost.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe6834a5306ce94030ff18573961ea147ad4ea39","amp;dn":"Lime+Creek+-+Joe+Henry+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe6834a5306ce94030ff18573961ea147ad4ea39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,104,52,165,48,108,233,64,48,255,24,87,57,97,234,20,122,212,234,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
