They hid wherever they could for as long as it took the Allies to win the war - Jewish children, frightened, alone, often separated from their families. For months, even years, they faced the constant danger of discovery, fabricating new identities at a young age, sacrificing their childhoods to save their lives. These secret survivors have suppressed these painful memories for decades. Now they share their moving wartime experiences - some for the first time. Inspiring and life-affirming, The Hidden Children is an unparalleled document of witness, discovery, and the miracle of human courage. 325 pages, few pictures. A must read for everyone.
