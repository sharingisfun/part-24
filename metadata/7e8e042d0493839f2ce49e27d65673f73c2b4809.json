After being found unconscious with no memory, she was shuffled in and out of foster homes where she suffered years of abuse. An experience that left her broken, damaged, and clinging to drugs and meaningless hook-ups to numb her pain.\n\nWhen Josie disappeared years ago, she took a piece of Tristan with her.  SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the girl he thought he lost foreverÃ¢â‚¬â€the one heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been able to forget.  Now a twist of fate has brought them back together, and he never wants to let her out of his inked arms again.  But Tristan is haunted by a dark past of his own.  On the run from ruthless criminals that shattered JosieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world years ago, reentering her life puts them both in danger.\n\nAs Josie and TristanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives become tangled once again, they find themselves unwilling and unable to escape the relentless pull that draws them together.  But will the past leave their love in ruinsÃ¢â‚¬â€or bind them together for a lifetime? \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e8e042d0493839f2ce49e27d65673f73c2b4809","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Addictions+-+Season+Vining+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e8e042d0493839f2ce49e27d65673f73c2b4809","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,142,4,45,4,147,131,159,44,228,158,39,214,86,115,247,60,43,72,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
