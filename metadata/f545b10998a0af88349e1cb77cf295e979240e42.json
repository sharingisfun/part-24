Amid a rich community of unforgettable island women and the exotic beauty of marshlands, tidal creeks, and majestic egrets, Jessie grapples with the tension of desire and the struggle to deny it, with a freedom that feels overwhelmingly right and the immutable force of home and marriage.\r\n\r\nIs the power of the mermaid chair only a myth? Or will it alter the course of Jessieâ€™s life? What happens will unlock the roots of her motherâ€™s tormented past, but most of all, it will allow Jessie to comes discover selfhood and a place of belonging as she explores the thin line between the spiritual and the erotic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f545b10998a0af88349e1cb77cf295e979240e42","amp;dn":"The+Mermaid+Chair+-+Sue+Monk+Kidd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f545b10998a0af88349e1cb77cf295e979240e42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,69,177,9,152,160,175,136,52,158,28,183,124,242,149,233,121,36,14,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
