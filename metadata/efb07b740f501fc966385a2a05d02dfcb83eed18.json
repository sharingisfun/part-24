It looks and sounds very different compared to vanilla HL2.\n It's free, so don't complain: If you don't like the mod, you can delete it and play something else. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢To play this mod, you must own Half Life 2 + Episode 1 + Episode 2 fully installed and unlocked! (= started at least once) You cannot play without Episode 2 content!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Remember to activate &quot;High Quality&quot; graphic settings in the options dialog. Especially the model setting must be at &quot;High&quot; or you'll get facial animation errors with HD models.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢You must enable HDR, when using the dynamic shadow enhanced maps. (Looks very weird and unnatural in LDR)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢If you are using HD characters, please re-initiate them with the new character pimper after updating the CM!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Foreign language users: Please reinitialize your preferred language with the configurator.\n\nPurpose of this mod\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Unified Engine; play the game (HL2 / EP1 / EP2) with the latest Orangebox engine / Advanced HDR / Dynamic Shadows\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Enhance the old HL2 maps with HDR, blooming, color-correction, new props, dynamic shadows\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Eliminate all blurry / Low-res textures with new Hi-res textures and/or Hi-res-Detail-Overlays\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Give the HL2 trilogy a more stressed, darker and uncomfortable look\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Enhance the soundtrack with a semi-dynamic new Hollywood-style music\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Add optional HD characters \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Add more replay-value\n\nHardware requirements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢DX9 capable graphics hardware with minimum 512 MB VRAM. (1 GB recommended)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢3 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)\n\nSoftware requirements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fully installed Steam client.

You will get a setup.exe with some subfolders. Do not unpack the archive in the subfolder. Just run setup.exe and follow the onscreen-instructions.\n\nThe mod has to be installed into the &quot;common&quot; folder inside the Steam directory structure. The installer will try to direct you to the right point. During installation the setup will migrate some VPK files from your half-life 2 installation into the mod directory.\n\nPlease assure the complete download of Half-Life 2 and its episodes, before trying to install the mod. Start HL2, EP1 and EP2 at least one time.\n\nThe installation will take a while","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efb07b740f501fc966385a2a05d02dfcb83eed18","amp;dn":"Half+Life+2+Cinematic+Mod+13+beta+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efb07b740f501fc966385a2a05d02dfcb83eed18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,176,123,116,15,80,31,201,102,56,90,42,5,208,45,252,184,62,237,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
