The album was co-produced by Bob Ezrin  and David Gilmour. Two songs, &quot;All Lovers Are Deranged&quot;, and the more radio-friendly &quot;Love on the Air&quot; were co-written by Gilmour, who composed the music, and his longtime friend, Pete Townshend of The Who, who served as lyricist. The remainder of the songs are credited solely to Gilmour himself. In May of the same year, fellow Floyd counterpart Roger Waters released his first official solo album The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking.\n\nThe album was recorded in France with engineer Andrew Jackson at a time when Pink Floyd's future was uncertain. The album was mixed by James Guthrie at Mayfair Studios in London.\n\nSome of the musicians working with Gilmour were Jeff Porcaro, Pino Palladino, Deep Purple keyboardist Jon Lord, Roy Harper, Michael Kamen (who also worked on Waters' album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking), Sam Brown and Steve Winwood.\n\n    Doing this album I wanted to make a really good record. I didn't want to do it very very quickly, and I wanted to get the best musicians in the world that I could get hold of to play with me, so I thought I'd just make a little list of all my favourite musicians, you know, best drummer, best bass player, best keyboard player, and I'll work through the list to see who I can get. Jeff Porcaro was top of my drummers list, Pino Palladino was top of my bass players list, and Ian Kewley, or the Rev, as he's known, he actually came and did the bulk of the hammond and piano playing, and he was terrific. Steve Winwood was top of my keyboard playing list but he couldn't do most of the album, but I got him to do a bit. He played hammond organ on &quot;Blue Light.&quot; I had a bit more time and was feeling a bit freer about things on this album...just more &quot;accidents&quot; tend to occur.\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½David Gilmour, \n\nAllegedly, some of the songs on About Face were being composed by Gilmour when Roger Waters began production of the Pink Floyd album, The Final Cut. Waters is said to have refused Gilmour's request for more time to complete his own (Gilmour's) material, which effectively denied Gilmour any writing credits on The Final Cut. Songs that are said to be of the pre-Final Cut period are &quot;Murder&quot;, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, &quot;Near the End&quot;, and the musical orchestration for &quot;Love on the Air&quot; and &quot;All Lovers are Deranged&quot;.\n\nDavid Jon Gilmour CBE (born 6 March 1946) is an English rock musician, best known as the lead guitarist, one of the lead singers, and one of the main songwriters in the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. In addition to his work with Pink Floyd, Gilmour has worked as a record producer for a variety of artists, and has enjoyed a successful career as a solo artist. Gilmour has been actively involved with many charities over the course of his career. In 2003, he was appointed CBE for services to music and philanthropy and was awarded with the Outstanding Contribution title at the 2008 Q Awards.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e8040840f63db60326915e6319537f8e0cbdcda","amp;dn":"David+Gilmour+-+Blue+Light+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e8040840f63db60326915e6319537f8e0cbdcda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,128,64,132,15,99,219,96,50,105,21,230,49,149,55,248,224,203,220,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
