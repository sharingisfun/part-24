Of the 90,000 troops that fought, over 23,000 were killed or wounded. Antietam also marked a significant turning point: General Lee's bold invasion of the North was halted, and the Union's success, though not exploited, gave President Lincoln the victory he needed to make his Emancipation Proclamation. The battle arguably sealed the fate of the Confederacy, even if the war still had nearly three years to run. This book accurately brings to life this significant and very costly engagement in highly accessible graphic novel format. It also includes eight pages of authoritative information placing Antietam in its historical context, describing the key players, the build-up to the battle and its aftermath","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1214de0bb1c6bf11c911d12ea487082e891bc27e","amp;dn":"The+Bloodiest+Day%3A+Battle+of+Antietam+%28Graphic+History%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1214de0bb1c6bf11c911d12ea487082e891bc27e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,20,222,11,177,198,191,17,201,17,209,46,164,135,8,46,137,27,194,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
