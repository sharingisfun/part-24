During the 1950s he acquired a reputation as a jazz pianist, arranger and composer. He is steeped, therefore, in both the traditions of classical virtuoso pianism and improvisational jazz.\n\nHe fuses these influences in his compositions, using jazz idioms in formal classical structures. An example of this is his Suite in the Old Style, Op. 28, written in 1977, which inhabits the sound world of jazz improvisation but is modelled on baroque suites such as the keyboard partitas composed by J. S. Bach, each movement being a stylised dance or a pair of dances in strict binary form. Other examples of this fusion are his set of 24 Preludes and Fugues, Op. 82, written in 1997, and the Op. 100 Sonatina.\n\nKapustin regards himself as a composer rather than a jazz musician. He has said, &quot;I was never a jazz musician. I never tried to be a real jazz pianist, but I had to do it because of the composing. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not interested in improvisation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and what is a jazz musician without improvisation? All my improvisation is written, of course, and they became much better; it improved them.&quot;\n\nAmong his works are 20 piano sonatas, six piano concerti, other instrumental concerti, sets of piano variations, ÃƒÂ©tudes and concert studies.\n\nRussian and Japanese record labels have released several recordings of the composer playing his own music. He has also been championed by a number of prominent pianists, including Steven Osborne, Marc-AndrÃƒÂ© Hamelin, Masahiro Kawakami and Ludmil Angelov, who released CDs devoted to Kapustin.\n\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Nikolai Kapustin - Jazz Pieces for Piano&lt;/strong&gt; /1985 [V0]\n01-08 Eight Concert Etude Op.40\n09-12 Piano Sonata No.1 &quot;Sonata Fantasy&quot; Op.39\n13 Suite in Old Style for Piano Op.28\n14 Variations for Piano Op.41\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Nikolai Kapustin - 24 Preludes in Jazz Style Op. 53&lt;/strong&gt; /1987 [320]\n01-24 24 Preludes in Jazz Style, Op. 53\n25 Sunrise for Piano Op. 26\n26 Toccatina for Piano Op.36\n27 Meditation (Contemplation) for Piano Op.47\n28 Sounds of Big Band for Piano Op.46\n29 Moving Force for Piano Op.45\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Nikolai Kapustin - Jazz Portrait&lt;/strong&gt; /1991 [V0]\n01 Andante for Piano, Op.58\n02-04 Sonata for Piano No.4, Op.60\n05-14 Ten Bagatelles for Piano, Op.59\n15-17 Sonata for Piano No.5, Op.61\n18-20 Sonata for Piano No.6, Op.62\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Nikolai Kapustin - Piano Sonatas Nos. 2 &amp; 3&lt;/strong&gt; /1991 [320]\n01-04 Sonata for Piano No.2 Op.54\n05 Sonata for Piano No.3 Op.55\n06 Andante for Piano Op.58\n07-08 Introduction and Scherzino for Violoncello Solo Op.93\n09-11 Duo for Alto Saxophone and Violoncello Op.99\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Nikolai Kapustin - Kapustin Piano Quintet etc&lt;/strong&gt; /2001 [320]\n&lt;em&gt;Nikolai Kapustin, piano; Alexander Korneev, Mariana Rubinstein, flute; Alexander Zagorinsky, cello; Alexander Chernov, Vladimir Spektor, violin; Svetlana Stepchenko, viola&lt;/em&gt;\n01-03 Trio for Flute, Cello and Piano Op.86\n04-07 Quartet for Two Violins, Viola and Cello Op.88\n08-11 Quintet for Two Violins, Viola, Cello and Piano Op.89\n12-14 Divertisment for Two Flutes, Cello and Piano Op.91\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Nikolai Kapustin - 24 Preludes and Fugues for Piano Op.82 Violin Sonata etc&lt;/strong&gt; /2001  [256]\nCD1: 01-34 24 Preludes and Fugues Op.82 - 1 a 17\nCD2: 01-14 24 Preludes and Fugues Op.82 - 18 a 24\n15 Elegy for Cello and Piano Op.96\n16 Buriesque for Cello and Piano Op.97\n17 Nearly Waltz for Cello and Piano Op.98\n18-20 Sonata for Violin Op.70\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Nikolai Kapustin - Last Recording&lt;/strong&gt; /2004 [320]\n01-04 Sonata for Piano No.7 Op.64 \n05 Berceuse for Piano Op.65\n06-08 Three Impromptu for Piano Op.66\n09-11 Three Etudes for Piano Op.67\n12 Impromptu for Piano Op.83\n13 Paraphrase on a Theme by P.
