When she falls for fellow artist and kindred spirit Jacob Solomon, she sees a chance to escape with him and realize her New York ambitions, but her decisions will have bitter and unexpected consequences.\n\nFans of Richard Russo, Amor Towles, Sebastian Barry, and Paula McLain will savor this transporting novel about the eternal tug between our duties and our desires, set in New York City and New England during the uncertain, tumultuous 1930s.\n\nGenre: Fiction/Historical","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:486dcc3ffb1bfceb508ecb38317de57c4605507d","amp;dn":"Cascade+by+Maryanne+O%27Hara","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"486dcc3ffb1bfceb508ecb38317de57c4605507d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,109,204,63,251,27,252,235,80,142,203,56,49,125,229,124,70,5,80,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
