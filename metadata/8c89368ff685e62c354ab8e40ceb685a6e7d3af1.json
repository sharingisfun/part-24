Where has apologetics gone wrong? What is the best response to the growing challenge presented by scientific discovery and naturalistic thought? Unlike every work on Christian apologetics that has come before, How to Defend the Christian Faith is the first one written by an atheist for Christians. As a former Christian defender who is now a leading atheist thinker, John Loftus answers these questions and more. He shows readers why Christian apologists have failed to reach the intelligent nonbeliever and offers practical advice for Christians, whether they want to better defend their faith against atheist arguments, or actively convert more individuals to Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\nEditorial Reviews\r\n\r\nâ€œI donâ€™t know anyone who can match the high definition clarity of John Loftus when it comes to navigating the labyrinthine world of Christian evangelical apologetics for the general public. This is a relentless and incisive critique of the pseudo-scholarship that passes for genuine intellectual inquiry under the name of Christian apologetics.â€ â€”Dr. Hector Avalos, Professor of Religious Studies, Iowa State University; author, The End of Biblical Studies, Slavery, Abolitionism, and the Ethics of Biblical Scholarship, and The Bad Jesus: The Ethics of New Testament Ethics \r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œLoftus is one of the few atheists who actually understands religion. This book displays the knowledge of a Christian theologian as well as rationality of an atheist. Both sides can learn a lot from it.â€ â€”Dr. David Eller, author, Natural Atheism, Atheism Advanced: Further Thoughts of a Freethinker, and Introducing Anthropology of Religion: Culture to the Ultimate\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œOnce again, Loftus raises the bar in the enduring conversation between atheists and Christian apologists with How to Defend the Christian Faith. This book will sharpen and hone the argument for either side, and woe to the unread debater going against someone who has absorbed this bookâ€™s relentless reasoning. I highly recommend this book for anyone who debates religionâ€”on either side.â€ â€”David Silverman, President, American Atheists, Inc\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œFor years I have despaired about the sorry state of Christian apologetics, and even sorrier state of Christian apologists. If there be Christian truth, it lies beyond the reach of rational inquiry, and perhaps that is OK. In How to Defend the Christian Faith, John Loftus lays waste to a colosseum full of bad arguments, including my own tentative efforts at the problem of evil. (Loftus says I am 'ignorant' but less ignorant than Ken Ham, which was a relief.) Believers should read Loftusâ€™s engaging assault on their intellectual champions. They will be dismayed at how often they agree. I know I was.â€ â€”Karl Gilberson, Scholar-in-Residence, Science &amp; Religion, Stonehill College; author, Saving the Original Sinner: How Christians Have Used the Bibleâ€™s First Man to Oppress, Inspire, and Make Sense of the World\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œThe world has just become a richer place. Who can calculate the added value to our planet when bright, young aspiring apologists decide to redirect their talents and energies to evidence-based careers? Many of themâ€”the ones who sincerely care about truthâ€”will certainly do that after reading the wise counsel in John Loftusâ€™ caring and sobering book. How to Defend the Christian Faith is a welcome mutual aid for Apologists Anonymous.â€ â€”Dan Barker, author, Life Driven Purpose: How an Atheist Finds Meaning; Co-President, Freedom From Religion Foundation\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Kudos to Loftus for another amazing text that will stand the test of time. My advice to readers? Buy it! Read it! Tell others about it, especially those who need it the mostâ€”evangelicals and believers who need a dose of objective reality and science-based reasoning.â€ â€”Sharon Nichols, retired Associate Professor, Geography, College of DuPage; former President, Illinois Geographical Society\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œWith wit and insight, Loftus offers the believer the tricks necessary to remain in the faith and to persuade others to do likewise. Self-delusion and deception are necessary attributes and Loftus humorously explains how it is done from someone who has been there. This is a great book for the believer who is ready to take an honest look at the moral and intellectual cost of his or her faith.â€ â€”Carolyn Hyppolite, author, Still Small Voices: The Testimony of a Born Again Atheist\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\nJohn W.
