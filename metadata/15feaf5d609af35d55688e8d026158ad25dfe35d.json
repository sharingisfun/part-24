Steve soon finds out that the egomaniacal Owen has gone through a series of secretaries who have left when they are fed up with his behaviour. He is constantly in debt and cannot begin to write a contracted novel that will pay his bills including a lucrative advance by his publisher. Steve perseveres until the novel, based on the events of Steve's life and that mentions a character based on his publisher shown in an unflattering light, is refused publication.\n\nOwen claims he cannot have a wife and a secretary so fires his wife and goes back to his old ways, hiring an admiring and attractive female to be his secretary. In the meantime Steve takes Owen's rejected manuscript to her former companion, Charles Harris, who is a major publisher. Harris, who now employs Elsie, Owen's former secretary before Steve, also asks to see Steve's manuscript.\n\nHarris finds Owen's manuscript interesting but ordinary, but believes Steve's manuscript to be not only worthy of publication but a serious candidate for literary prizes. Steve initially refuses publication due to hurting Owen's fragile ego but soon changes her mind because of the philandering. She hires an attractive male secretary and the two writers compete with each other.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 835 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 1:34:33\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 1:34:33 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15feaf5d609af35d55688e8d026158ad25dfe35d","amp;dn":"My+Dear+Secretary+%281948%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Laraine+Day%2C+Kirk+Douglas+%5BD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15feaf5d609af35d55688e8d026158ad25dfe35d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,254,175,93,96,154,243,93,85,104,142,141,2,97,88,173,37,223,227,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
