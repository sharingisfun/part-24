It is also the text used in most police academies, including the prestigious FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. It emphasizes essential procedures, combines detailed techniques with instructive case studies, and outlines the foundation on which to build a solid, prosecutable case.\n\nThe fundamental criminal investigative techniques stressed in the Fourth Edition are crucial for effective inquiry into sudden and violent death. Eminent author, lecturer, consultant, and expert witness Vernon J. Geberth begins the book with a comprehensive discussion of homicide crime scenes. The book evolves chronologically from initial police notification, the correct police response that follows, and the subsequent steps necessary to conduct an intelligent investigation. It then delves into more technical aspects of homicide investigation, augmented with numerous pictures and full-color illustrations that involve pertinent case histories.\n\nThe book features two new chapters along with major revisions of those from the previous edition. In addition it contains 675 photos and illustrations - including 300 new entries that incorporate depictions of wound structures and procedures that portray exactly what to do and how to do it. All illustrations are presented in full color, including new medical-legal drawings for instruction and courtroom testimony.\n\nVernon Geberth was featured in an interview on News 14 Carolina in Fayetteville discussing his 3-day seminar on Practical Homicide Investigation.\n\nHe also discusses the book in a video on the CRC Press YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 1072 pages\n# Publisher: CRC Press; 4 edition (February 8, 2006)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0849333032\n# ISBN-13: 978-0849333033","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f59379715c8cafa743c5087a82d6039fddec336f","amp;dn":"Practical+Homicide+Investigation%2C4th+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f59379715c8cafa743c5087a82d6039fddec336f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,147,121,113,92,140,175,167,67,197,8,122,130,214,3,159,221,236,51,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
