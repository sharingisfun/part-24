Created and originally written by Joe Pruett, Kilroy seems to pop up wherever innocents are harmed, in order to reap vengeance for them. This takes him everywhere from a Klan massacre in 1923 to Tienanmen square in 1989.\n\nThis special edition served as the introduction to the regular Kilroy series, and featured stories from Guy Burwell, Tim Bradstreet, Andrew Robinson, and others.\n\n\nPlease Seed and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58ce098b00ea1da80ac9dd5631788184610f2c53","amp;dn":"Kilroy%3A+The+Short+Stories+%28Caliber+Comics%29+%28Rumor-Novus-HD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58ce098b00ea1da80ac9dd5631788184610f2c53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,206,9,139,0,234,29,168,10,201,221,86,49,120,129,132,97,15,44,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
