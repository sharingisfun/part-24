Cast\n\n\n\nListening to the likeable quintet Ellen and the Escapades, who describe themselves as Ã¢â‚¬Å“alternative folkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a familiar dilemma presents itself. The particular discomfort of the folk community when one of its own breaks into wider public consciousness is nothing new: the Folk Police are a much more established enforcement agency than the Funk Wardens, or the Custodians of Crossover Thrash. No aspect of leftist culture is without its self-destructive splits and the sniping, the sneers and slurs of Ã¢â‚¬Å“selling outÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are as much a folk motif as any other casually-sketched stereotype of a music harder to classify than it is to parody cheaply. However, the rise of nu-folk as a chart force and its assimilation into mainstream culture has attracted much warranted scrutiny: when bands appropriate the aesthetics and commodify the sound (for what is now a massive mass-market export) itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bound to leave a bad taste. Talented lead singer Ellen Smith and her group have already been alluded to as a female-fronted Mumford &amp; Sons, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an understandable tag.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/05/04/ellen-and-the-escapades/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/05/04/ellen-and-the-escapades/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b427f11d99e4312f103f5619657f972c75dad586","amp;dn":"Ellen+and+the+Escapades...All+the+Crooked+Scenes%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b427f11d99e4312f103f5619657f972c75dad586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,39,241,29,153,228,49,47,16,63,86,25,101,127,151,44,117,218,213,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
