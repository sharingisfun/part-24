One of the first British bombers to see service in World War, it carried a payload similar to the Wellington and Whitley, but was much faster and more maneuverable. It was the newest design of these three, sporting a very slender fuselage and fixed guns. It was indeed faster and more agile but the defensive armament was inadequate and was later updated. Still and all, the aircraft was a poor performer and was ultimately retired in 1942. However, as a civil aircraft and warbird, the Hampden makes an excellent viewing platform and is a great place to practice those tailwheel skills.\n\n** FS2004 and FSX only **\n\nFeatures - \n\n- 3 unique model variants :\n\n1.
