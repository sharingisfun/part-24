All Things Must Change\n\n&quot;Kirsty McGeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest album Contraband deals in wounds and healing with remarkable honesty, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not always a comfortable listen. Not through any paucity of quality, but because it openly deals with her recovery from depression and what she describes as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a string of personal disastersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Close to quitting music for good, she instead cobbled together a band of friends and collaborators and distilled the pain in arguably its most potent form Ã¢â‚¬â€ great songwriting. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unapologetically raw and intense, the rest is melancholy squared. Yet, by the end you come away feeling hopeful and restored, rather than weighed down by the relentless waves of emotion.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e9cec86d9c5853112abc50ca2d86f62088b306c","amp;dn":"Kirsty+McGee+-+Contraband+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e9cec86d9c5853112abc50ca2d86f62088b306c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,156,236,134,217,197,133,49,18,171,197,12,162,216,111,98,8,139,48,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
