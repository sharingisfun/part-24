If you are considering a career in research, have already embarked on your career and want to succeed, are uncertain which route to take or advise, train or supervise scientists, this book offers some helpful advice.\n\nNancy Rothwell, a senior scientist with extensive experience training scientists and communicating with the public, covers topics ranging from choosing a PhD or postdoctoral position, successful interviews and preparing your cv to managing your supervisor; how to give successful talks, publish high quality papers and become known within your field. Broader aspects of science which are so important today are also covered, including ethics and fraud, intellectual property and exploitation and disseminating science to the public.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfb333a42b13370e0b6c752c5b61d6a407bace28","amp;dn":"Who+Wants+to+be+a+Scientist%3F%3A+Choosing+Science+as+a+Career","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfb333a42b13370e0b6c752c5b61d6a407bace28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,179,51,164,43,19,55,14,11,108,117,44,91,97,214,164,7,186,206,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
