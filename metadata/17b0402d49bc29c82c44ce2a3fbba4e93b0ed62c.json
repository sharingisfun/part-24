In a first-past-the-post electoral \nsystem (currently used in only USA, UK, and Canada), the candidate in any \nlocal riding with the most votes wins.  This works OK when there are only \n2 candidates, but with 3 or more, it often leads to vote splitting, allowing \na relatively unpopular candidate (or party) to still win.  It also leads to \nhighly divisive politics. \n\nUsing a form of modified proportional representation, such as \nGermany does, where any party getting 5% or more of the popular vote\nalso gets that percentage of the seats in the legislature allows \nparties with distributed geographic support to still have some clout. This \nencourages the creation of new and responsive parties to appeal to smaller\npolitical constituencies.\n\nAnother good alternative is preference balloting, where voters record their \nfirst, second, and third choice (etc).  If any candidate has more than 50%\nsupport counting only first choices, then she wins.  If nobody does, then \nlook at the first and second choices.  If still nobody has more than 50%, then\nlook at first, second, and third choices, etc.  Continue until a candidate is \nfound who has the support of more than 50% of voters.  Preference ballotting\ntends to select the candidate that is the least offensive to the most number\nof people, and thus encourages inclusive concensus-building politicians.\n\n-- freeflow123\n\nThis release covers... \n\nA Christmas Carol\nA Clean, Well-Lighted Place\nA Clockwork Orange\nA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\nChronicle of a Death Foretold\nClarissa\nCloud 9\nCold Mountain\nCold Sassy Tree\nComing of Age in Mississippi\nCommon Sense\nContinuity of Parks\nCoriolanus\nCrime and Punishment\nCry, the Beloved Country\nCyrano de Bergerac\nreadme.txt\nThe Chosen\nThe Chrysanthemums\nThe Clouds\nThe Color of Water\nThe Color Purple\nThe Comedy of Errors\nThe Contender\nThe Count of Monte Cristo\nThe Crucible\nThe Crying of Lot 49\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\n1984\n2001 A Space Odyssey\nA Border Passage\nA&amp;P\nAbsalom, Absalom!\nAcross Five Aprils\nAdam Bede\nAgamemnon\nAlas, Babylon\nAlice in Wonderland\nAll But My Life\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\nAll the King's Men\nAll the Pretty Horses\nAll's Well That Ends Well\nAmerican Dream\nAnd Then There Were None\nAngela's Ashes\nAngels in America\nAnimal Dreams\nAnimal Farm\nAnna Karenina\nAnne of Green Gables\nAnnie John\nAnthem\nAntigone (The Oedipus Plays)\nAntigone\nAntony and Cleopatra\nArcadia\nArrowsmith\nAs I Lay Dying\nAs You Like It\nAtlas Shrugged\nBabbitt\nBabylon Revisited\nBarn Burning\nBel Canto\nBeloved\nBeowulf\nBible?
