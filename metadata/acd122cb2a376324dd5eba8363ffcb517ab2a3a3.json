He has devised a plan to cripple the American greatness, \nhumble the U.S. military, and elevate Japan to a position of dominance on the world stage. \nYamata's motivation lies in his desire to pay off a Debt of Honor to his parents and \nto the country he feels is responsible for their deaths: America. \nAll he needs is a catalyst to set his plan in motion. \nWhen the faulty gas tank on one Tennessee family's car leads to their fiery death, \nan opportunistic U.S. congressman uses the occasion to rush a new trade law through \nthe system. The law is designed to squeeze Japan economically. Instead, \nit provides Yamata with the leverage he needs to put his plan into action. \nAs Yamata's plan begins to unfold, it becomes clear to the world that someone is \nlaunching a fully integrated operation against the United States. \nThere's only one man to find out who the culprit is: Jack Ryan, \nthe new president's National Security Advisor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acd122cb2a376324dd5eba8363ffcb517ab2a3a3","amp;dn":"Tom+Clancy+-+Hedersskuld+%28Ljudbok%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acd122cb2a376324dd5eba8363ffcb517ab2a3a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,209,34,203,42,55,99,36,221,94,186,131,99,255,203,81,122,178,163,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
