Gusev, V. Litvinenko, A. Mordkovich. \n\nThis book is intended for students at pedagogical (teacher training)\ninstitutes majoring in mathematics or in mathematics and physics. It\nhas been written in correspondence with the current syllabus &quot;Solving\nProblems&quot;.\n\nWhen preparing the text, we wanted to represent the main types of\nproblems in geometry found at school. The book contains about 1000\nproblems that should be solved independently. Alongside rather simple\nproblems, there are problems whose solution requires profound\nmeditation and sometimes even a nonstandard approach. The solution of\nmoat of the problems in this book will help the student form the\nprofessional habits important for a future teacher of mathematics,\nthat is, to know how to solve the geometrical problems covered by the\nmathematics syllabus for high schools and vocational schools.\n\nThis book was translated from the Russian by Leonid Levant. The book\nwas published by first Mir Publishers in 1988.\n\n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  DJVU | 2.3 MB | Pages: 239 | OCR | Cover\n\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\nTable of Contents\nPreface 5\nChapter 1.
