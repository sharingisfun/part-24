White Noise 04:32\n\nLauren OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connell tiptoed onto the music scene with her 2007 debut Sitting in Chairs, a beautifully simple one-track acoustic album. Her third offering Quitters is a lot more confident and has a heck of a lot more gumption in it that the title would suggest. The album captures perfectly the sound of the ultimate American road trip; Lauren herself hailing from Rochester, New York and ending up in California. If big horizons, sunsets and campfires had a soundtrack, it would be this. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not quite country and not quite folk, just a lovely happy medium thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as far from Dolly Parton as it is from Laura Marling.\n\nThe album opens with the understated optimism and infectious percussion of Ã¢â‚¬ËœEvery SpaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, topped off with LaurenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inimitable warm sun-and-whiskey-drenched vocals. Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Will Burn You DownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ follows, with jangly guitar and raw, lamenting lyrics; roughly along the lines of Ã¢â‚¬Å“pull yourself together and move onÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, just a lot more eloquently put.\n\nThe duet Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Belong To YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, with fellow California-based singer Ryan Lerman, is full of harmonies and oohs and ahhs, and everything you could really ask for from a love song. It features the Wilco-countering line Ã¢â‚¬Å“nothing is just born to dieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with infinite more positivity and sincerity than Lana Del Rey could ever feign. The dreamy Ã¢â‚¬ËœIn The Next RoomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the penultimate track on the album, with the strings and keys creating a waltz-like quality.\n\nConsidering all this, it would be too easy to mentally file Quitters along with all the twee fauxksters, next to the boutique bunting and teacups gathering dust in the synapse of your brain that resembles an InstagramÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d basement in Brixton. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something a lot more authentic about this album. The girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got guts. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of feist in the brutally honest lyrics of Ã¢â‚¬ËœMaybe True StoriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also present in the stunning, nearly-eight-minute-long Ã¢â‚¬ËœIf Found/GravityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which contains the unrelenting refrain of Ã¢â‚¬Å“I want something returned to meÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Perhaps captured within this one song is LaurenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whole musical career thus far; from a sweet and uncertain beginning, to a powerful crescendo of tenacity.\n\nIgnore this review. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t listen to it. Listen to Lauren OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connell. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s might not be shouting very loudly, but what she is saying is with conviction, and the way sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saying it is beautiful.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a20d69eeef57179302bd4c33486c64e26e1bb4d9","amp;dn":"Lauren+O%27Connell...Quitters%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a20d69eeef57179302bd4c33486c64e26e1bb4d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,13,105,238,239,87,23,147,2,189,76,51,72,108,100,226,110,27,180,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
