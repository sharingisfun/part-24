While I am more able to provide current issues, IF I can find what you are looking for I will try and post it for you.  Nemesis43 on KAT has far more resources than I and is a better bet, but I will do what I can to help the communities.  Please message me privately for requests so as not to clutter up comment sections with unrelated material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis series is a monthly treat for Marvel fans, since each issue brings new stories and exciting battles for a variety of Marvel super-heroes, including Ms. Marvel, the Uncanny X-Men, Spider-Man, Moon Knight, Hercules, Magik, Speedball, Cloak &amp; Dagger, Marvel Boy and Namor, the Sub-Mariner. Each issue features a set of stories which team up the super-heroes, or showcases them individually. \n\n\n\n\nThis collection was gathered from other torrents.  If anyone knows who the scanner or group source are please let me know and I will give proper credit.
