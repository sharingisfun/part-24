That's what she really wanted to write. By the time her best friend, Josie, edited and clicked &quot;Send,&quot; her personals ad was more fantasy than reality.\n\nOR WOULD SHE GET MORE THAN SHE BARGAINED FOR?\n\nWhen two different guys -- Dylan Stanwyck and Mike Pine -- replied within two days, she seemed doubly blessed. After a first date with model-turned-firefighter Dylan that ended in bed -- and with a huge misunderstanding -- Laura came home from her Walk of Shame to an invitation for a hike with ski instructor Mike. The Great Outdoors became the setting for so much more...\n\nCaught between two men -- literally -- who turned out to be roommates and secret billionaires, Laura makes a startling discovery about her own capacity for passion.\n\nAnd, maybe, long-term love in an unconventional romance with two men that pushes every boundary.\n\nIncluding her own.\n\nThis 122,000 word/450 page boxed set includes all four parts of the Her Billionaires series (Her First Billionaire, Her Second Billionaire, Her Two Billionaires, Her Two Billionaires and a Baby)\n\n\n\n================\n\nFor more quality uploads, please visit my profile and my thread :\n                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================\n\nDovah\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:824cf32cf645881f1657b592eed6b536fbf8bffa","amp;dn":"Julia+Kent%2C+Her+Billionaires+The+Complete+Collection+erotica+azw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"824cf32cf645881f1657b592eed6b536fbf8bffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,76,243,44,246,69,136,31,22,87,181,146,238,214,181,54,251,248,191,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
