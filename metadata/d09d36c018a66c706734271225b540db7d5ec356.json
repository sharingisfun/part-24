As a ronin, he should not exist. In his flight from his clan he meets another ronin ninja, a woman named Sugaru. Sugaru, wanting only to live in peace, is very distrustful. Her paranoia is shown to be justified. The manga covers Kamui's struggle to leave his past behind and Sugaru's failure to do the same.\n\nWritten and penciled by Sanpei Shirato, Legend of Kamui was published bi-weekly by Eclipse (in partnership with Viz) in 1987-88 and ran for 37 issues. Along with Mai, the Psychic Girl and Area 88, Kamui was one of the first manga series translated for American audiences.\n\nThis torrent contains all 37 issues. Plaudits to the creator and the scanners! Score it, scatter it!\n\n\n\nStaying with the manga theme, check out 'Mai, the Psychic Girl'! Also published bi-weekly in 1987-88, it ran for 28 issues. Please note, THIS IS NOT THE ECLIPSE VERSION! Rather, this is the four-volume collection released shortly thereafter by Viz. Since I have yet to find any of the original issues, this will have to do.
