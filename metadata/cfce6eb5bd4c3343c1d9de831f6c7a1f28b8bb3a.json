The company intricately devises and implements schemes, custom tailored to match the interests of their intended target, for the ultimate goal of obtaining romance for their client. The boss and mastermind behind the agency is Byung-Hoon (Eom Tae-Woong). Things take a strange twist at the Cyrano Agency when a new client named Sang-Yong (Daniel Choi) enters their office. Sang-Yong is a straight-laced financial trader who is rather inept with personal relationships. He has fallen for a free spirited woman named Hee-Joong (Lee Min-Jung) and seeks out the Cyrano AgencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help. The boss for the Cyrano Agency, Byung-Hoon, then notices that Hee-Joong is his ex-girlfriend with whom he has really never gotten over Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfce6eb5bd4c3343c1d9de831f6c7a1f28b8bb3a","amp;dn":"Cyrano+Agency+%28K-Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfce6eb5bd4c3343c1d9de831f6c7a1f28b8bb3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,206,110,181,189,76,51,67,193,217,222,131,31,108,122,31,40,184,187,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
