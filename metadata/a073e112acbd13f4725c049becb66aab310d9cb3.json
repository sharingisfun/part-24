The original authors (Daniels, Williams, and Worthingham) and the current authors have all had long careers in physical therapy, each with close to 60 years of active participation in various roles as clinicians, anatomists, hysiologists, and educators. Together in their overlapping careers in physical therapy, they have assured this book a permanent place in the history and literature of the profession.\nWe have not added any substantial new subject material to the text, but have revised most of the test illustrations to better reflect the constituency of the profession.\nA major addition to the eighth edition is a new DVD produced by Judith Burnfield, PT, PhD, which will especially serve newer readers who use contemporary technology\nfar more than do the partially fossilized authors. We are deeply indebted to Dr. Burnfield for this excellent and prodigious contribution.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a073e112acbd13f4725c049becb66aab310d9cb3","amp;dn":"Hislop+2007+Daniels+and+Worthingham%27s+Muscle+Testing+8th+Techniq","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a073e112acbd13f4725c049becb66aab310d9cb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,115,225,18,172,189,19,244,114,92,4,155,236,182,106,171,49,13,156,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
