The story traces the life and career of Charles Foster Kane, a man whose career in the publishing world was born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolved into a ruthless pursuit of power and ego at any cost. Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story is revealed through the research of a newspaper reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word, &quot;Rosebud.&quot;\n\nCitizen Kane is often cited as being one of the most innovative works in the history of film, and in 1998 the American Film Institute placed it at number one in its list of the 100 greatest U.S. movies of all time. In a recent poll of film directors conducted by the British Film Institute, Citizen Kane was ranked number one best film of all time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d1520012abd5bbf14395de061366d7fe928594c","amp;dn":"Citizen+Kane+%281941%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d1520012abd5bbf14395de061366d7fe928594c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,21,32,1,42,189,91,191,20,57,93,224,97,54,109,127,233,40,89,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
