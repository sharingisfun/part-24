Hadley (AgentParsec). It shares the same gameplay elements as the original - you must collect 8 pages while avoiding the enemy. This is not intended to be a copy - simply a way for people who loved Slender to be able to face their fear on a different map with the same awesome gameplay. There are some differences which will make playing a somewhat unique experience - different AI, new sounds, and a different environment.\n\nv1.0 of Mansion has been released.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b820a0a54b755b0285e80f73d228e9c85497a0c5","amp;dn":"Slender+-+Mansion+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b820a0a54b755b0285e80f73d228e9c85497a0c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,32,160,165,75,117,91,2,133,232,15,115,210,40,233,200,84,151,160,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
