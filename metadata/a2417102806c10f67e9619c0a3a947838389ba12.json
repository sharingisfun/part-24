Later that year, Grell created an original James Bond tale entitled 'Permission to Die', which he scripted and illustrated himself. The story unfolded over three issues and finally finished up in 1991.\n\nAll of the above can be found in this torrent. A standing O to the creators and scanners! Catch it, release it!\n\n\n\nPart two of this ECUP is 'Hotspur'! Published in 1987, the three-issue mini was written by John Ostrander and penciled by Ken Waller. It was RESTORED and uploaded by LeonardTSpock in October of 2012, and he describes the series as follows:\n\nMedievaly, renaissancey, d&amp;d-like, swashbuckling, superhero kinda thing. Ya know, with a suave, sarcastic hero, evil lizard man, a wizard, barbarians, ghosts, attractive women and a flying eyeball. That kind of thing.\n\nSo, go get it here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7767074/Hotspur_(Restored)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7767074/Hotspur_(Restored)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand do that download/upload thing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2417102806c10f67e9619c0a3a947838389ba12","amp;dn":"James+Bond+007+%28Eclipse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2417102806c10f67e9619c0a3a947838389ba12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,65,113,2,128,108,16,246,126,150,25,192,163,169,71,131,131,137,186,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
