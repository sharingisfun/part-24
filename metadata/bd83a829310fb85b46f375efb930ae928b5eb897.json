We rarely do snapshot updates to fix bugs, but since 21a contained an annoying bug \n\nthat made it hard to play single-player we decided to do one this week. There are \n\nstill problems, but weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re getting there!\n\n\n\n2. We added a new creative mode inventory screen.\n\n3. We also updated the language files to correct the diamond/emerald mix-up in the    \n\n   language files (diamonds were previously called emerald in the code, which caused \n\n   a lot of confusion when we added a real emerald item). We had to ban another \n\n   translator for griefingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ it?s astonishing how much work some people put into these \n\n   thingsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd83a829310fb85b46f375efb930ae928b5eb897","amp;dn":"Minecraft+1.3.6+%5B+PreRelease+6.5+%5D+12w21b+-+JKoop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd83a829310fb85b46f375efb930ae928b5eb897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,131,168,41,49,15,184,91,70,243,117,239,185,48,174,146,139,94,184,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
