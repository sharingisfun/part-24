In the days that followed, Ronald Defeo confessed to methodically shooting his parents and four siblings while they slept. He claimed &quot;voices&quot; in the house drove him to commit the murders. \n\nOne year later, George and Kathy Lutz and their children moved into the house thinking it would be their dream home. But shortly after settling in, bizarre and unexplainable events began to occur ? nightmarish visions and haunting voices from an evil presence still lurking within the house. \n\n28 days after moving in, the Lutzes abandoned the home, lucky to escape with their lives.
