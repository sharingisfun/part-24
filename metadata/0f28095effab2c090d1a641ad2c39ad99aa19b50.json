First go to http://www.daemon-tools.cc/ then click download then look for Daemon Tools Lite v 4.30.4 then click download.\n\n2. Once you have finished downloading the torrent, go to the folder of the torrent then mount the DELTAFORCE2.mds file. (By opeining up Daemon Tools Lite and then you should see a icon on the the lower right coner then you would right click it then click Virtual CD/DVD-ROM then click on your divce then click mount image and then it should come up with a Select image file tab or screen then browse for the DELTAFORCE2.mds file then then you hilight the DELTAFORCE2.mds file by clicking on it and then click open.)\n\n3. As soon that is done an autorun menu should apear and you should know what to do from then on there.\n\n&gt;&gt;If you already have Daemon Tools Lite then you can skip step one.\n  System Requirements are in the README file and the bonus stuff like Misson Editor is in the DELTAFORCE2.mds file.   \n \n* I included the CD-Key in the torrent because you have to enter it while you are in the setup.\n\nMulitplayer doesn't work because novaworld doesn't support it anymore so just enjoy the game and have fun fragging.\n\nPlease rate on this torrent and ask for help if needed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f28095effab2c090d1a641ad2c39ad99aa19b50","amp;dn":"Delta+Force+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f28095effab2c090d1a641ad2c39ad99aa19b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,40,9,94,255,171,44,9,13,26,100,26,210,195,154,217,154,161,155,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
