Add these nutrient-packed superfoods to your diet and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be cooking meals that are high in health benefits and low in calorie count.\n\nDid you know that adding more of the right kind of grains to your diet can stimulate healthy digestion, help control blood sugar levels, aid weight control and reduce the risk of heart disease? Supergrains explores twelve of these grains: quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, brown rice, chia, millet, oats, spelt, kamut, barley, farro and freekeh, all of them nutrient-packed superfoods for a healthy body and heart.\n\nSupergrains have been around for centuries but, until recently, forgotten in favor of highly refined grains, like white rice and white wheat flour, that make up most of our grain consumption. Refined grains are stripped of the nutrients, healthy fats and antioxidants found in supergrains: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to get back to the good grains!\n\nSupergrains gives you the nutritional statistics for each grain, and invaluable tips on what they are best used for and how to cook them. Six of the grains are gluten-free and many of them are a complete source of proteinÃ¢â‚¬â€which means these fresh and tasty recipes are a great choice for restricted diets, such as gluten- or wheat-free, vegetarians and vegans.\n\nAll 100 recipes use ingredients that are readily available at your local grocery store, and have easy-to-follow, step-by-step methods. With Supergrains youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be cooking healthy, delicious meals that your whole family will love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c283bd4af64d693c3c13d8aec8f0965df0473f2","amp;dn":"Supergrains%3A+Cook+Your+Way+to+Great+Health","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c283bd4af64d693c3c13d8aec8f0965df0473f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,40,59,212,175,100,214,147,195,193,61,138,236,143,9,101,223,4,115,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
