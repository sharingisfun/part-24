Completely updated, revised and expanded from the authors previous works, this book is the one resource you need to succeed in the green building marketplace.\n\nWith a sound grounding in contemporary marketing theory and practice, the book assembles hard-to-find information to assist executives and partners in design and construction firms in crafting competitive strategies that build on their firm strengths, while shoring up their weaknesses. Since most design and construction firms specialize in particular market sectors, the book systematically examines the important market segments for green buildings. It also presents key business case justifications for green buildings that help architects, engineers and builders to understand client motivations and respond to them with appropriate marketing tactics and communications strategies.\n\nThe book examines how the green building market is adopting certain new products and design approaches, information that will help manufacturers and product sales teams to craft appropriate marketing strategies. The book also helps owners and developers understand the green building business case and to find out what other leading-edge firms and projects have learned - how to market and sell green buildings and green developments in a highly competitive marketplace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48084abfac977a84a1870a64bfb8bdbd4efcd1ac","amp;dn":"Marketing+Green+Building+Services%3A+Strategies+for+Success","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48084abfac977a84a1870a64bfb8bdbd4efcd1ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,8,74,191,172,151,122,132,161,135,10,100,191,184,189,189,78,252,209,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
