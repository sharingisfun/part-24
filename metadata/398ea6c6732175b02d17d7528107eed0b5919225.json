KanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢NalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShamanic Rock,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ documented on their second release and Sony Red debut, Dreamwalker, conveys the power of these spectacles.\n\nFor years, songwriter/vocalist Tzol was drawn to explore Mexico and Central America. On one particular journey in early 2001, Tzol met guitarist Tierro in the village of San Marcos on the magical lake Atitlan. Writing songs and performing together in Guatemala inspired them to capture their vision on an album.\n\nAfter recording the first KanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Nal CD in TierroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hometown Toronto, the two returned to lake Atitlan the following year. At their very first show, they were joined by songwriter/bassist Rodolfo Escobar and performance artist Teresita Hinojosa. With this addition KanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Nal gained a new visual and mystical dimension. Living together near the lake, all four drew inspiration from the beauties and hardships that surrounded them.\n\nOne by one the group encountered the others destined to join their tribe. Aaron Jerad, another traveler on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLa Ruta Maya,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ came into the picture while they were visiting the Yucatan peninsula. His foundational percussion and solid didgeridoo playing added further elements of trance and rhythm Leaving Mexico they added Gilly Gonzalez, whose ferocious drumming had made him a figure of legend in Texas. Completing the circle, artist and dancer Akayate joined the band in Colorado. Her gift for costume design and movement enhanced the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s visual and storytelling elements.\n\nThe music... the dancesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ the story-songs proclaim ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtear down the bordersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦unite the colorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ bring down the fire and walk as oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGypsyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and demand ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshake my bones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“til they shatter/shake my soul like a rattleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDesert FlowerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) These are the cries that have flown over the Nevada desert at Burning Man, sounded from the Rockies at Dreamtime in Colorado, and echoed through the Earthdance Festival in California, drawing thousands of listeners to join KanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Nal on their journey.\n\nOne people, one color, one earth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:398ea6c6732175b02d17d7528107eed0b5919225","amp;dn":"Kan%5C%27nal+Dreamwalker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"398ea6c6732175b02d17d7528107eed0b5919225","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,142,166,198,115,33,117,176,45,23,215,82,129,7,238,208,181,145,146,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
