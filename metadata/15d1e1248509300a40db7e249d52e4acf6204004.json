On Copperhead Road, Earle opted to record in Memphis and veered away from mainstream country in several directions at once ? into potent hard rock (most notably on the superb title song, which became his first rock radio hit), as well as Irish folk (with the Pogues backing Earle on &quot;Johnny Come Lately&quot;) and even bluegrass (virtuoso acoustic pickers Sam Bush and Jerry Douglas sit in on &quot;Nothing But a Child&quot;). If Copperhead Road lacked a bit of the tight focus of his acclaimed debut, Guitar Town, it had energy, firepower, and smart-ass humor to spare (along with Earle&amp;#039;s always-superb songs), and it made clear that Steve Earle had the stuff to be a contender in rock &amp; roll, if that were what he wanted. \n____________________________________________________________________\n\n\nSteve Earle - Copperhead Road (Deluxe Edition)\n\n\nRip Info\n--------\n\nArtist: Steve Earle\nAlbum Title: Copperhead Road (Deluxe Edition)\nRecord Label: Geffen\nRip Date: 2008-05-06\nCatalog Number:\nGenre: Rock\nYear: 2008\nSource: CD/Multiple Discs\nEncoder: LAME 3.97 -V2 --vbr-new\nQuality: 198 kbps avg / 44.1KHz / Joint Stereo\n\n\nTrack List\n----------\n\n\nDisc: 1\n-------\n01 Copperhead Road                                4:30\n02 Snake Oil                                      3:30\n03 Back To The Wall                               5:28\n04 The Devil&amp;#039;s Right Hand                         3:03\n05 Johnny Come Lately                             4:10\n06 Even When I&amp;#039;m Blue                             4:14\n07 You Belong To Me                               4:24\n08 Waiting On You                                 5:10\n09 Once You Love                                  4:39\n10 Nothing But A Child                            4:25\n\nDisc: 2\n-------\n01 The Devil&amp;#039;s Right Hand (Live in Raleigh,       4:02\n   North Carolina, November 18, 1987)\n02 Fearless Heart (Live in Raleigh, North         4:31\n   Carolina, November 18, 1987)\n03 San Antonio Girl (Live in Raleigh, North       4:23\n   Carolina, November 18, 1987)\n04 Nobody But You / Continental Trailways Bus     6:25\n   (Live in Raleigh, North Carolina, November\n   18, 1987)\n05 My Baby Worships Me (Live in Raleigh, North    3:33\n   Carolina, November 18, 1987)\n06 Wheels (Live in Raleigh, North Carolina,       4:45\n   November 18, 1987)\n07 The Week Of Living Dangerously (Live in        7:25\n   Raleigh, North Carolina, November 18, 1987)\n08 Johnny Come Lately (Solo) (Live in Raleigh,    3:55\n   North Carolina, November 18, 1987)\n09 Brown And Root (Live in Raleigh, North         3:46\n   Carolina, November 18, 1987)\n10 I Love You Too Much (Live in Raleigh, North    4:27\n   Carolina, November 18, 1987)\n11 It&amp;#039;s All Up To You (Live in Raleigh, North     6:10\n   Carolina, November 18, 1987)\n12 Nebraska (Solo) (Live, 1988)                   5:21\n13 Copperhead Road (Live in Calgary, Canada,      4:08\n   April, 1989)\n14 I Ain&amp;#039;t Ever Satisfied (Live in Calgary,       3:51\n   Canada, April, 1989)\n15 Dead Flowers (Live in Calgary, Canada, April,  5:36\n   1989)\n16 Little Sister (Solo) (Live in Calgary,         3:15\n   Canada, April, 1989)\n17 Guitar Town (Live in Calgary, Canada, April,   2:36\n   1989)\n                                                --------\n                                                02:01:42\n                                                182.90 megs\n\nRip Notes\n---------\n\nCompletely Remastered.\n\nTracks 1 - 11 on Disc 2 Previously Unreleased.\n\nNever one to mince words, Steve Earle told his biographer Lauren St John,\n&quot;COPPERHEAD ROAD was &amp;#039;f*$@ you,&amp;#039; to an extent.&quot; Released Oct. 17, 1988, the\nalbum was indeed a raised middle finger to Nashville&amp;#039;s country music\nestablishment, which had viewed the intransigent singer-songwriter&amp;#039;s swift rise\nin the late &amp;#039;80s with undisguised distaste. Brazenly explosive and hard-rocking,\nit was not the work of an artist who would be ?or would want to be ?embraced\nby the Grand Ole Opry. It also marked the commercial pinnacle of his career&amp;#039;s\ntumultuous first chapter.\n\nThe public responded to COPPERHEAD ROAD as MCA had hoped: The album won\nwidespread mainstream critical acclaim and substantial rock radio airplay, and\nbecame Earle&amp;#039;s second gold release. The set broadened his fan base in a way many\nin Music City had not foreseen. It must have been a satisfying moment for\ncountry&amp;#039;s most persistent anti-authoritarian: He had proved Nashville wrong.\n\nThe present expanded Deluxe Edition offers a deep look at Earle on stage in the\nmonths surrounding the recording and release of COPPERHEAD ROAD. A November 1987\nperformance from Raleigh, North Carolina, by the Exit 0 band includes early\nrenditions of &quot;The Devil&amp;#039;s Right Hand&quot; and &quot;Johnny Come Lately,&quot; plus three\nnumbers dating back to his Epic sessions and covers of songs by his Nashville\ncompadre Rodney Crowell and early influence Gram Parsons. Springsteen receives\nhomage in a 1988 solo version of his brooding &quot;Nebraska.&quot; Finally, five songs\nfrom an April 1989 Canadian date reveals the stops-out potency of the Copperhead\nRoad-era Dukes on the road.\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15d1e1248509300a40db7e249d52e4acf6204004","amp;dn":"Steve+Earle-Copperhead+Road+%28Deluxe+Edition+2CD%29+%282008-VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15d1e1248509300a40db7e249d52e4acf6204004","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,209,225,36,133,9,48,10,64,219,126,36,157,82,228,172,246,32,64,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
