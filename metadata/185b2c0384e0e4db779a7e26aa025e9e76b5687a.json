Until then, keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars.&quot;\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCheech &amp; Chong are number 39 with their &quot;novelty&quot; hit, &quot;Earache My Eye.&quot;\n\nOne artist in the countdown was once told by a record producer that he was too good to make it in the record business. If he wanted to succeed, he would have to learn to play as badly as Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nThree Dog Night is in the countdown with their 19th consecutive top 40 hit.\n\nA listener writes in with this question, &quot;What act has had the most number one hits (so far) in the 70's?&quot; The band that holds that title has had four number ones, and had them all in the same year, AND they were the first four songs this band ever released!\n\nHear Casey say, &quot;Here's a song by a southern rock group; seven men who call themselves, 'Lynyrd Skynyrd.'&quot;\n\nThere's a song in the countdown that would have caused the arrest of the man who owns the label that released it, if the police would have caught him the first time he listened to it.\n\nA listener asks, &quot;What artist has had more top ten records than anyone else?&quot; With 63 top ten hits, the answer to this one is not the Beatles or Elvis.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What Canadian artist holds the record for most weeks at number one?&quot;\n\nCasey tells if the song at number 4, &quot;The Night Chicago Died,&quot; by Paper Lace, is based on a true story or not.\n\nThere's a song by an artist who wrote a poem when he was 14-years-old, to a girl that was 4 years older. When she turned him down, he put his poem to music and had a hit that made him the youngest self-made millionare in the record business.\n\n40: CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get Enough - Bad Company\n39: Earache My Eye - Cheech &amp; Chong\n38: Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me - Elton John\n37: Sugar Baby Love - Rubettes\n36: I Love My Friend - Charlie Rich\n35: Sure As I'm Sitting Here - Three Dog Night\n34: Call On Me - Chicago\n33: Taking Care Of Business - Bachman Turner Overdrive\n32: Time For Livin' - Sly &amp; The Family Stone\n31: Don't Change Horses In The Middle Of The Street - Tower Of Power\n30: Free Man In Paris - Joni Mitchell\n29: Who Do You Think You Are - Bo Donaldson &amp; The Haywoods\n28: Sweet Home Alabama - Lynyrd Skynyrd\n27: Another Saturday Night - Cat Stevens\n26: I Honestly Love You - Olivia Newton-John\n25: Beach Baby - First Class\n24: Waterloo - Abba\n23: Let's Put It All Together - Stylistics\n22: Keep On Smilin' - Wet Willie\n21: It's Only Rock 'N Roll -  Rolling Stones\n20: Shinin' On - Grand Funk\n19: You Haven't Done Nothin' - Stevie Wonder\n18: Please Come To Boston - Dave Loggins\n17: Clap For The Wolfman - Guess Who\n16: Rub It In - Billy &quot;Crash&quot; Craddock\n15: Wild Thing - Fancy\n14: Hang On In There Baby - Johnny Bristol\n13: Sideshow - Blue Magic\n12: Nothing From Nothing - Billy Preston\n11: Then Came You - Dionne Warwick &amp; The Spinners\n10: You And Me Against The World - Helen Reddy\n9: Can't Get Enough Of Your Love, Babe - Barry White\n8: Rock Me Gently - Andy Kim\n7: Wildwood Weed - Jim Stafford\n6: I'm Leaving It All Up To You - Donny &amp; Marie Osmond\n5: Feel Like Makin' Love - Roberta Flack\n4: The Night Chicago Died - Paper Lace\n3: Tell Me Something Good - Rufus\n2: I Shot The Sheriff - Eric Clapton\n1: (You're) Having My Baby - Paul Anka\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:185b2c0384e0e4db779a7e26aa025e9e76b5687a","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1974_August_31st","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"185b2c0384e0e4db779a7e26aa025e9e76b5687a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,91,44,3,132,224,228,219,119,154,126,38,170,2,94,158,118,181,104,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
