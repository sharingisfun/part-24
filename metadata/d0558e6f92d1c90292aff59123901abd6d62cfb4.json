Casanova wrote as much about food as he did about sex, detailing what he ate, and whom he slept with, in every major European city in the eighteen century. Casanova was a devotee of the Kabbalah and credited his success in life to Kabbalistic ideals of living in the moment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0558e6f92d1c90292aff59123901abd6d62cfb4","amp;dn":"Casanova+%28by+Ian+Kelly%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0558e6f92d1c90292aff59123901abd6d62cfb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,85,142,111,146,209,201,2,146,175,245,145,35,144,26,189,109,98,207,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
