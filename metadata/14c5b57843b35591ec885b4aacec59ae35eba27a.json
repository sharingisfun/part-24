You'll see firsthand Rodriguez's whirlwind, &quot;Mariachi-style&quot; filmmaking, where creativity - not money - is used to solve problems. Culminating in Robert Rodriguez's &quot;Ten-Minute Film School&quot;, this book may render conventional film-school programs obsolete. Rodriguez also offers an insider's view of the amazing courtship he enjoyed with Hollywood's A-list. It's an entertaining tour of Hollywood's deal-making machine as he navigates you through studio meetings, pitch sessions, and power lunches with the biggest names in the industry. Candidly divulging all the tactics and tempting lures the warring studios used to win him over, he admits that he barely escaped with his movie and his soul intact. Exploding the conventional wisdom that you need at least a million dollars to make a feature film, Rodriguez's inspiring nuts-and-bolts account features the full El Mariachi shooting script, postproduction tips, film festival anecdotes, and publicity blitz secrets. He clearly demonstrates the countless ways to do for free what the pros spend thousands (or more) on without a second thought. Rebel Without a Crew is both one man's remarkable story and the essential guide for anyone who has a celluloid story to tell and the dreams and determination to see it through.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14c5b57843b35591ec885b4aacec59ae35eba27a","amp;dn":"Rebel+Without+a+Crew%2C+Or%2C+How+a+23-Year-Old+Filmmaker+With+%247%2C00","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14c5b57843b35591ec885b4aacec59ae35eba27a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,197,181,120,67,179,85,145,236,136,91,74,172,236,89,174,53,235,162,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
