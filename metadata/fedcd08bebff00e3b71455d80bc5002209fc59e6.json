It anticipates both the sophistication of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kind of BlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the rawness of 1960s &quot;new thing&quot;, yet it remained unreleased until 1962 while RCA concentrated on Elvis Presley.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Tijuana MoodsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comprises two ten-minute tone poems Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ysabel's Table DanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Los MariachisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - framed by two idiosyncratic standards (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dizzy MoodsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, adapted from Gillespie's Ã¢â‚¬Å“Woody 'n' YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“FlamingoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) with the short but labyrinthine Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tijuana Gift ShopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the middle.\n\nThis is jazz composition of the highest order, in which improvisation - wild, controlled, sublime - is an integral part of Mingus's scores, with their complex part-writing, extended harmonies and constant variation of tempo and feel. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tijuana MoodsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ looks ahead to Mingus's later masterpiece, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Indispensable.\n\n\nCharles Mingus\n\nTijuana Moods (The Master Takes)\n\nRecorded in 1957, released in 1962\n \n\n  CD / 2011 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
