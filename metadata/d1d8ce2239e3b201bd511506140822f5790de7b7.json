The title refers to an Arabic female name. The song was originally performed by Algerian raÃƒÂ¯ artist Khaled. The original French single was never released in an album, though Khaled's 1996 album &quot;Sahra&quot; featured a bilingual version of the song sung in both French and Arabic. The Arabic lyrics for the bilingual version of the song are written by Khaled. Khaled's music video was directed by Sarah Moon.\n\n    In 2003, the Danish hip hop band, Outlandish, recorded and released an English version of the song &quot;Aicha&quot; which was included in their album &quot;Bread &amp; Barrels of Water&quot; and was produced &amp; and musically performed by Mintman aka Carsten Mortensen . The song peaked at #2 in the Mega Single Top 100 for 2 weeks and for 3 weeks in the Swedish Singles Chart. It also reached the top in Switzerland, and #3 in Austria and Norway and #8 in Belgium.
