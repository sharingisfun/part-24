They gained a dedicated following in the UK in the mid-1980s as a post-punk/gothic rock band with singles such as &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot;, before breaking mainstream in the US in the late 1980s as a hard rock band with singles such as &quot;Love Removal Machine&quot; and &quot;Fire Woman&quot;. \r\n\r\nThe band fuse a &quot;heavy metal revivalist&quot; sound with the &quot;pseudo-mysticism ... of the Doors [and] the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin ... while adding touches of post-punk goth rock&quot;. Since their earliest form in Bradford during 1981, the band have had various line-ups; the longest-serving members are vocalist Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy, the band's two songwriters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter moving to London, the band released the album Love in 1985, which charted at No. 4 in the UK, and which included singles such as &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot;. In the late 1980s, the band supplemented their post-punk sound with hard rock in their third album, Electric; the polish on this new sound was facilitated by Rick Rubin, who produced the record. \r\n\r\nTheir fourth album, Sonic Temple, proceeded in a similar vein, and these two LPs enabled them to break into the North American market.\r\n\r\nYear:\t1989\r\n\r\nStyle:\tHard Rock\r\n\r\nCountry: United Kingdom\r\n\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\n\r\nSize:\t121.21 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t01/11/2016\r\n\r\nFiles:\t12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\nLength :0:52:25\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n\r\n01 - Sun King\r\n02 - Fire Woman\r\n03 - American Horse\r\n04 - Edie (Ciao Baby)\r\n05 - Sweet Soul Sister\r\n06 - Soul Asylum\r\n07 - New York City\r\n08 - Automatic Blues\r\n09 - Soldier Blue\r\n10 - Wake Up Time For Freedom\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers\r\n\r\n    Ian Astbury â€“ lead vocals, percussion (1983â€“1995, 1999â€“present)\r\n    Billy Duffy â€“ guitar (1983â€“1995, 1999â€“present)\r\n    Grant Fitzpatrick â€“ bass (2015â€“present)\r\n    John Tempesta â€“ drums (2006â€“present)\r\n\r\nTouring musicians\r\n\r\n    Damon Fox â€“ keyboards, second guitar (2015â€“present) \r\n    Grant Fitzpatrick - bass (2015â€“present)\r\n\r\nOne of my alltime favorites .
