But can a wrong turn be made rightÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½and \ncan the heart of a hardened man still be moved by a second chance at \nhappiness? Here's a hard-hitting, uniquely American tale of raw courage, \nhaunting regret, and hope against all odds as only Louis L'Amour can tell it.\n\nHIGH LONESOME\n\nConsidine bristled at the word &quot;thief,&quot; but that's what he was. He'd been out \nof money, and one mistake had just led to another. Now he had four years of \ncrime behind him and little to show for it-except the dubious honor of being a \nhunted man all over the country. But just south of the border there was one \nlast chance it could all pay off. Obaro was a tough town full of tough \nmenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½boasting a bank no one had ever tapped. But it wasn't just the bank \nthat rankled Considine, it was the man who ran Obaro. Sheriff Pete Runyon \nwas a friend turned rival who'd married the girl Considine once loved. He was \nalso the only man to beat Considine in a knock-down fight. Outwitting Runyon \nnow would be sweet revenge on many levels. Then Considine could just take \nthe money and runÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½literallyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½to the border, buy a small ranch, and start \nanew.\n\nConsidine didn't count on meeting Lennie, a beautiful young woman, and her \ntrail-savvy but reckless father, a former outlaw trying to get far enough \naway from his past to give his daughter a future. The two were headed \nstraight for Apache country and certain death. Now Considine and his gang \ncan either ride like hell for the border just ahead of an angry posseÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½or join \nthe old man and the girl in a desperate last stand atop High Lonesome against \nblood-hungry warriors. The choice is simple: risk the hangman's noose or an \nApache bullet. \n\n----\n\nLouis L'Amour is undoubtedly the bestselling frontier novelist of all time. He is \nthe only American-born author in history to receive both the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold Medal in honor of his life's \nwork. He has published ninety novels; twenty-seven short-story collections; \ntwo works of nonfiction; a memoir, Education of a Wandering Man; and a \nvolume of poetry, Smoke from This Altar. There are more than 300 million \ncopies of his books in print worldwide.\n\n----\n\nRead by David Strathairn\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:280d0f5acc25da304973d928e2444d3873091b38","amp;dn":"Louis+L%5C%27Amour+-+High+Lonesome","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"280d0f5acc25da304973d928e2444d3873091b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,13,15,90,204,37,218,48,73,115,217,40,226,68,77,56,115,9,27,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
