Clive &quot;Max&quot; Maxfield renowned author, columnist, and editor of PL DesignLine has selected the very best FPGA design material from the Newnes portfolio and has compiled it into this volume. The result is a book covering the gamut of FPGA design from design fundamentals to optimized layout techniques with a strong pragmatic emphasis. In addition to specific design techniques and practices, this book also discusses various approaches to solving FPGA design problems and how to successfully apply theory to actual design tasks. The material has been selected for its timelessness as well as for its relevance to contemporary FPGA design issues.\n\nContents\nChapter 1 Alternative FPGA Architectures\nChapter 2 Design Techniques, Rules, and Guidelines\nChapter 3 A VHDL Primer: The Essentials\nChapter 4 Modeling Memories\nChapter 5 Introduction to Synchronous State Machine Design and Analysis\nChapter 6 Embedded Processors\nChapter 7 Digital Signal Processing\nChapter 8 Basics of Embedded Audio Processing\nChapter 9 Basics of Embedded Video and Image Processing\nChapter 10 Programming Streaming FPGA Applications Using Block Diagrams In Simulink\nChapter 11 Ladder and functional block programming\nChapter 12 Timers\n\n*Hand-picked content selected by Clive &quot;Max&quot; Maxfield, character, luminary, columnist, and author\n*Proven best design practices for FPGA development, verification, and low-power\n*Case histories and design examples get you off and running on your current project\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 488 pages\n# Publisher: Newnes (March 4, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1856176215\n# ISBN-13: 978-1856176217","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e7f6f2b04c784dedbfb595a0e1555d2c262ac2c","amp;dn":"FPGAs%3A+World+Class+Designs%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e7f6f2b04c784dedbfb595a0e1555d2c262ac2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,127,111,43,4,199,132,222,219,251,89,90,14,21,85,210,194,98,172,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
