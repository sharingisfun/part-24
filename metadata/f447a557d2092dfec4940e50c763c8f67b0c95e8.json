Run Printopia on your Mac to share its printers to your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. Add unlimited virtual printers to save print-outs to your Mac as PDF files\n\nWireless Printing To Your Mac's Printers\n\nWhether you have an inkjet printer plugged into your Mac, a laser printer plugged into your router or even a network printer, if your Mac can print to it, Printopia will share it. Is your printer plugged into your AirPort or Time Capsule? No problem. Printopia translates for your printer, allowing it to speak to your iPhone or iPad even if it's not an AirPrint-compatible printer. Printopia even supports many password-protected printers.\n\nEasy, Instant Set-up\n\nEcamm puts ease of use first. Double-click to install Printopia, and within seconds see most any connected printers on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. You'll also see Printopia's &quot;Send To Mac&quot; and &quot;Send To Dropbox on Mac&quot; virtual printers. That's it!\n\nPower When You Need It\n\nBehind Printopia's simple interface lies a ton of advanced features to customize your mobile printing experience. Configure printer settings, such as paper size, print quality and color options. Set up virtual printers to save files anywhere, or send files directly to a Mac app. \n\nSerious Security For Privacy and Peace of Mind\n\nWith the addition of password protection for your printers, Printopia is a great solution for a shared environment such as an office of classroom. Industry standard encryption protects your print jobs between your iOS device and your Mac.\n\nSave Paper With A Printopia Virtual Printer\n\nAdd unlimited &quot;Send To Mac&quot; virtual printers to your network. This lets you &quot;print&quot; a PDF or JPG file directly to your Mac or even send files directly to a Mac app. No need to waste paper next time you need to print a confirmation page. Keep your files organized by configuring multiple virtual printers with different save destinations.\n\nPrint To Your Mac's Dropbox Folder\n\nusers can print PDF and JPG files directly to the Mac's Dropbox folder. Dropbox will take care of syncing your printouts for access anywhere you go.\n\nNo Need To Modify Your Operating System\n\nBeware of printing solutions that re-configure your Mac's printing system. Printopia runs independently from printer sharing, and does not modify your Mac or iOS operating system in any way. \n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nPPC or Intel Mac with Mac OS X.5 and above and support for iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch running iOS 4.2 or newer\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f447a557d2092dfec4940e50c763c8f67b0c95e8","amp;dn":"Printopia+v+2.0+%5BK%5Dracked+%2B+manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f447a557d2092dfec4940e50c763c8f67b0c95e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,71,165,87,210,9,45,254,196,148,14,80,199,99,200,246,123,12,149,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
