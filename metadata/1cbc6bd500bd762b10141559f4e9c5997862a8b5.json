Blind for the first twenty years of her life, Kendra Michaels learned at an early age to become hyper-aware of her surroundings, perfecting the art of picking up the most subtle audio, olfactory, and tactile cues in the world around her. Kendra's astonishing powers of observation and analysis have made her a favorite of law enforcement agencies all across the country. She cares little for investigative work but canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deny her unique skill, or the results sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been able to facilitate. Like a secret weapon, she is in high demand, but her talents are put to the test when her mentor calls on her to help solve a mysterious disappearance and she uncovers one explosive secret that not even the police want her to find.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cbc6bd500bd762b10141559f4e9c5997862a8b5","amp;dn":"With+Open+Eyes+-+Iris+Johansen.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cbc6bd500bd762b10141559f4e9c5997862a8b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,188,107,213,0,189,118,43,16,20,21,89,244,233,197,153,120,98,168,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
