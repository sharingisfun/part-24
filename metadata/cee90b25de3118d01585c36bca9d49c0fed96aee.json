The text uses the &quot;novel experimental experiences&quot; of various contributors from around the worldâ€”designed as case studiesâ€”to highlight relevant topics, issues, and recent developments surrounding this highly interdisciplinary field. It factors in metagenomics and microbial biofuels production, and incorporates major contributions from a wide range of disciplines that include microbiology, biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, chemistry, biochemical engineering, and bioprocess engineering. In addition, it also provides a variety of photos, diagrams, and tables to help illustrate the material.\r\n\r\nThe book consists of 15 chapters and contains subject matter that addresses:\r\n\r\nMicrobial biotechnology from its historical roots to its different processes\r\nSome of the new developments in upstream processes\r\nSolid-state fermentation as an interesting field in modern fermentation processes\r\nRecent developments in the production of valuable microbial products such as biofuels, organic acids, amino acids, probiotics, healthcare products, and edible biomass\r\nImportant microbial activities such as biofertilizer, biocontrol, biodegradation, and bioremediation\r\n\r\nStudents, scientists, and researchers can benefit from Microbial Biotechnology: Progress and Trends, a resource that addresses biotechnology, applied microbiology, bioprocess/fermentation technology, healthcare/pharmaceutical products, food innovations/food processing, plant agriculture/crop improvement, energy and environment management, and all disciplines related to microbial biotechnology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cee90b25de3118d01585c36bca9d49c0fed96aee","amp;dn":"Microbial+Biotechnology+-+Progress+and+Trends","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cee90b25de3118d01585c36bca9d49c0fed96aee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,233,11,37,222,49,24,208,21,133,195,107,202,157,73,192,254,217,106,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
