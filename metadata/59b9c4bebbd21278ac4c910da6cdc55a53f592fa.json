The two-hour movie event is executive produced by Howard Braunstein, Debra Martin Chase and Wendy Williams, and based on the bestseller &quot;Aaliyah: More Than a Woman&quot; by former Time Magazine music editor Christopher John Farley (Game World).\n\nBefore Beyonce and before Rihanna, self-proclaimed &quot;street but sweet&quot; Aaliyah was poised to become a global icon with top-selling albums, a hot movie career and an adoring fan base. The film follows the beautiful and talented performer's inspirational journey, from her debut on &quot;Star Search&quot; at the age of 10 to the challenges she faced during her rise to become the Princess of R&amp;B. On August 25, 2001, at the height of her popularity, her life was tragically cut short when a plane carrying the singer and some of her video crew crashed after takeoff from a Bahamian runway. Although just 22-years-old at the time of her death, Aaliyah continues to lead a legacy as Billboard's tenth most famous R&amp;B artist of the past 25 years and one of the recording industry's most successful artists in history.\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\ntitle........: aaliyah: princess of r &amp; b (2014)\n genre(s).....: biography/music/drama\n runtime......: 01:25:00\n size.........: 621MB\n resolution...: 720x404\n video........: x264\n audio........: AAC 2ch\n air date.....: 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59b9c4bebbd21278ac4c910da6cdc55a53f592fa","amp;dn":"Aaliyah.Princess.of.R%26amp%3BB.2014.HDTV.x264-DaViEW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59b9c4bebbd21278ac4c910da6cdc55a53f592fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,185,196,190,187,210,18,120,172,76,145,13,166,205,197,90,83,245,146,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
