He plays a variety of instruments, including the guitar, harmonica, keyboards, drums, and saxophone. Featuring his characteristic growlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a unique mix of folk, blues, soul, jazz, gospel, and Ulster Scots Celtic influencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Morrison is widely considered one of the most unusual and influential vocalists in the history of rock and roll.[2][3][4] Critic Greil Marcus has gone so far as to say that &quot;no white man sings like Van Morrison.&quot; \nKnown as &quot;Van the Man&quot; by his fans, Morrison first rose to prominence as the lead singer of the Northern Irish band Them, writing their 1964 garage rock classic hit, &quot;Gloria&quot;. A few years later, Morrison left the band and embarked on a successful solo career.\nMorrison has pursued an idiosyncratic musical path. Much of his music is tightly structured around the conventions of American soul and R&amp;B, such as the popular singles, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;, &quot;Moondance&quot;, &quot;Domino&quot; and &quot;Wild Night&quot;. An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as his classic album Astral Weeks and lesser known works such as Veedon Fleece and Common One.[6][7] The two strains together are sometimes referred to as &quot;Celtic Soul&quot;.Morrison's career, spanning some five decades, has influenced many popular musical artists. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2000, Morrison ranked number twenty-fifth on American cable music channel VH1's list of its &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Rock and Roll&quot;,] and in 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Van Morrison forty-second on their list of &quot;Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.[10][11] Paste ranked him twentieth in their list of &quot;100 Greatest Living Songwriters&quot; in 2006. Q ranked him twenty-second on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Singers&quot; in April 2007 and he was voted twenty-fourth on the November 2008 list of Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d63d8714703734b687718965b9cb56b799d21d9","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison-Astral+Weeks-Live+At+The+Hollywood+Bowl-2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d63d8714703734b687718965b9cb56b799d21d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,99,216,113,71,3,115,75,104,119,24,150,91,156,181,107,121,157,33,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
