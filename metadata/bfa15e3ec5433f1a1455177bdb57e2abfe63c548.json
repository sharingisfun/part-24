Like fellow chillwavers, he sings wistfully over a blend of acoustic instruments and electronic programming, and uses a retro Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s palette of synth sounds. After the Be So True EP and Sunndreamm EP generated a buzz online in 2010, Diaz announced that his first full-length, Replicants, would become available in early 2011.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfa15e3ec5433f1a1455177bdb57e2abfe63c548","amp;dn":"MillionYoung+-+Variable+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfa15e3ec5433f1a1455177bdb57e2abfe63c548","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,161,94,62,197,67,63,26,20,85,23,123,219,87,226,171,254,99,197,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
