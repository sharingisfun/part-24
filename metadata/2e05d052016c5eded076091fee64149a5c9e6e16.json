Seventeen-year-old Edward Zanni, a feckless Ferris BuellerÃ¢â‚¬â€œtype, is Peter Panning his way through a carefree summer of magic and mischief. The fun comes to a halt, however, when EdwardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father remarries and refuses to pay for Edward to study acting at Juilliard.\n\nEdwardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s truly in a bind. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ineligible for scholarships because his father earns too much. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unable to contact his mother because sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s somewhere in Peru trying to commune with Incan spirits. And, as a sure sign heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s destined for a life in the arts, EdwardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incapable of holding down a job. So he turns to his loyal (but immoral) misfit friends to help him steal the tuition money from his father, all the while practicing for his high school performance of Grease. Disguising themselves as nuns and priests, they merrily scheme their way through embezzlement, money laundering, identity theft, forgery, and blackmail. But, along the way, Edward also learns the value of friendship, hard work, and how youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not really a man until you can beat up your fatherÃ¢â‚¬â€metaphorically, that is.\n\nHow I Paid for College is a farcical coming-of-age story that combines the first-person tone of David Sedaris with the byzantine plot twists of Armistead Maupin. It is a novel for anyone who has ever had a dream or a scheme, and it marks the introduction to an original and audacious talent.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nPublishers Weekly\nPortland humor columnist Acito debuts with dazzling comic panache in this story of a teenage would-be swindler and budding drama queen. Edward Zanni is dying to escape boring Wallingford, N.J., for the hallowed halls of Juilliard, and he's got a pretty good chance at it. It's summer, and he's palling around with his fellow Play People, who include his gorgeous girlfriend, Kelly, and his hot jock pal, Doug, and dreaming of stardom. The fly in the ointment is Zanni's money-obsessed father, Al, who pulls the financial plug on Edward's Juilliard dream after marrying a trophy babe, a beautiful, icy Teutonic model named Dagmar. Edward counters dad's penny-pinching by moving in with Kelly's family to establish financial independence for a scholarship, but bombs at several minimum-wage jobs. How will he pay for college now that his audition really a public mental breakdown got him in? His devious buddy, Nathan, concocts a plan to steal from gold-digging Dagmar, who's been siphoning Al's cash into a secret account. Edward and pals set up a fake nonprofit designed to award a Juilliard scholarship to someone born in Hoboken (Edward) but there's a problem. Acito nails his scenes one after another, from Edward's shifting (but always enthusiastic) sexuality to the silly messes he gets himself into. The result is a thumbs-up winner from a storyteller whose future looks as bright as that of his young hero. Agent, Edward Hibbert. (Sept.) Forecast: Acito's playful, nuanced treatment of sexual exploration and lively plot should make this an appealing choice for older YA readers as well as adults.
