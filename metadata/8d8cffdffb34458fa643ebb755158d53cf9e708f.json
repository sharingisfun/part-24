Songs similarly explore Belew's fascination with raw animal nature: &quot;Big Electric Cat&quot; (the album's obvious single) is exactly that, howling five-stringed felines over a propulsive Afro-funk beat, and &quot;Animal Grace&quot; is its less frazzled companion. But Belew can also be gentle, exploring guitar synth ambience on &quot;Naive Guitar&quot; and even performing a duet with his four-year-old daughter Audie Belew on &quot;The Final Rhino.&quot;\nTracks\n\t\t\n\n1 Big Electric Cat \tBelew \t4:53\n2 The Momur \tBelew \t3:44\n3 Stop It \tBelew \t2:51\n4 The Man in the Moon \tBelew \t3:50\n5 Naive Guitar [instrumental] \tBelew \t4:03\n6 Hot Sun [instrumental] \tBelew \t1:30\n7 The Lone Rhinoceros \tBelew \t4:02\n8 Swingline \tBelew \t3:28\n9 Adidas in Heat \tBelew \t2:47\n10 Animal Grace \tBelew \t4:02\n11 The Final Rhino [instrumental] \tAudie Belew, Belew \t1:23\n\nNMR, plus covers\n@192","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d8cffdffb34458fa643ebb755158d53cf9e708f","amp;dn":"Adrian+Belew+-+Lone+Rhino+%281982%29+192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d8cffdffb34458fa643ebb755158d53cf9e708f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,140,255,223,251,52,69,143,166,67,235,183,85,21,141,83,207,158,112,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
