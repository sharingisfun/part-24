It covers a range of topicsÃ¢â‚¬â€from the elementary to the advancedÃ¢â‚¬â€including the spontaneous emission of radiation, stimulated transitions and the properties of gas, the physics and applications of resonance fluorescence, optical pumping, cooling and trapping of charged and neutral particles, and atomic beam magnetic resonance experiments. Written by a practicing experimental physicist, the text reflects the latest advances in the field, supplying a contemporary understanding of the subject","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e56e4b6e1b21ed3fdef5418da73d1b402af8c36","amp;dn":"Modern+Atomic+Physics+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e56e4b6e1b21ed3fdef5418da73d1b402af8c36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,86,228,182,225,178,30,211,253,239,84,24,218,115,209,180,2,175,140,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
