An extramarital love affair offers only temporary satisfaction -- it is the European turmoil of World War I which provides an opportunity to abandoning his banal Chicago existence and becoming a participant rather than an observer in life. Upon returning to Chicago Dorn finds his wife re-married and his love for the other woman dead. Only emptiness remains.\n\n\n\n\n\nMademoiselle of Monte Carlo\n\n\n\nThe Master of Mystery waves his magic wand again. In this book the strange inter-relationships between the \\&quot;upper crust\\&quot; and the underworld are revelaed with convincing realism. Besides the elusive \\&quot;Mademoiselle,\\&quot; we come in tantalizing conact with the \\&quot;Sparrow,\\&quot; the incredible super criminal whose emissaries and operatives baffle the greatest detectives of Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the Vanishing Point\n\n\n\nWhen George Randolph first caught sight of Orena, he was astounded by its gleaming perfection. Here were hills and valleys, lakes and streams, glowing with the light of the most precious of metals. And, more astonishing than that, it was a world of miniature perfection--an infinitely tiny universe within a golden atom!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kama Sutra of Vatsayayana\n\n\n\nAn ancient Indian text on human sexual behavior, widely considered to be the standard work on love in the Sanskrit literature. The text was written by Vatsyayana. The author is believed to have lived sometime between the 1st to 6th centuries A.D, probably during the Gupta period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Art of War\n\n\n\nTranslated from the Chinese with Introduction and Critical Notes by Lionel Giles, M.A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Book of The Damned\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original and greatest compilation of 1,001 attested phenomena that science cannot answer and deliberately ignores.\n\nApprox. 107,893 words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFifteen Thousand Useful Phrases\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten while Cleland was in debtor\\&amp;#039;s prison, Fanny Hill is considered the first \\&amp;#039;erotic\\&amp;#039; novel.\n\nApprox. 84,264 words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Call of Cthulhu\n\n\n\nThree independent narratives linked together by the device of a narrator discovering notes left by a deceased relative. Piecing together the whole truth and disturbing significance of the information he possesses, the narrator\\&amp;#039;s final line is \\&amp;#039;\\&amp;#039;The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.\\&amp;#039;\\&amp;#039;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWar and Peace\n\n\n\nThe novel tells the story of a number of aristocratic families and the entanglements of their personal lives with Napoleon\\&amp;#039;s invasion of Russia. As events proceed, Tolstoy systematically denies his subjects any significant free choice: the onward roll of history determines happiness and tragedy alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98c27daccef50ed66e418dfe4998072826f94995","amp;dn":"Classic.eBooks.Pack.September.15.-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98c27daccef50ed66e418dfe4998072826f94995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,194,125,172,206,245,14,214,110,65,141,254,73,152,7,40,38,249,73,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
