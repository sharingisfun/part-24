And smart. And hilarious. And weird ... in all kinds of good ways. Prepare to be weirded out. And to enjoy it.&quot; \n--Charles Yu, author of &quot;How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe&quot;&quot;\n&quot;\nWhat do you do when you wake up hung over and late for work only to find a stranger on your couch? And what if that stranger turns out to be an Adversarial Manifestation--like Satan, say--who has brewed you a fresh cup of fair-trade coffee? And what if he offers you your life's goal of making the bestseller list if only you find his missing Lucky Cat and, you know, sign over your soul? \nIf you're Billy Ridgeway, you take the coffee. &quot;From the Trade Paperback edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe886b4787356c950c6f87c7db52fdf908a4132e","amp;dn":"Jeremy+P.+Bushnell+-+Weirdness-+A+Novel+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe886b4787356c950c6f87c7db52fdf908a4132e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,136,107,71,135,53,108,149,12,111,135,199,219,82,253,249,8,164,19,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
