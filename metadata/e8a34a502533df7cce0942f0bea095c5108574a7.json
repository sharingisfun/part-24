The only thing that's clear is they're two of most ornery, trouble-making warriors that've ever lived. It's action-adventure comedy, sword &amp; sorcery-style. Before their new comic series began, the Skullkickers kicked their way across two short stories in Image's Eisner Award-winning Popgun anthology series. Discover these two tales and an exclusive sneak peek at the first issue of Skullkickers.\n\nThanks goes to Nothing for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8a34a502533df7cce0942f0bea095c5108574a7","amp;dn":"Skullkickers+00+%282010%29+%28Nothing-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8a34a502533df7cce0942f0bea095c5108574a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,163,74,80,37,51,223,124,206,9,66,240,190,160,149,197,16,133,116,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
