Yes, I know how difficult it is to get started with Cisco studies. But stick to it and I promise, the challenges will pay off handsomely. The CCNA is Cisco's entry level certification exam, but it is not easy. And since the CCNA covers a wide array of topics, I have designed this course to help you tackle those diverse challenges. The key to exam and job success is in the details. And most of those details are hard won from real world experience. Everything I am going to teach you, I wish someone would have taught me when I first started studying for my CCNA. At least you can benefit from my hard won experience and hopefully not repeat the same mistakes.\n\nAs with all Train Signal courses, I break down the theory and &quot;real world&quot; application of Cisco Networking. This exciting course contains nearly 29 hours of video instruction where I break down networking theory as you work hands on with real Cisco routers &amp; switches... and build your own working network!\n\nProfessional Training\n\nNearly 29 Hours (28 Hours, 54 Minutes, 54 Seconds) of Cisco CCNA Training Videos Jam Packed on 4 DVDs!\nMultiple File Formats Make it convenient for you to learn anywhere you go! iPod Video, Mp3 Audio, .WMV &amp; high quality .AVI video\nPDF of Instructor Notes allow you to follow along with the videos and take more organized notes\nInstant Access Online to the entire training course\nExam Preparation\n\nComplete Exam Coverage This course covers all of the bases required for you to pass:\n640-802 - Cisco Certified Network Associate Exam\nFREE, FULL VERSION of Transcender's Practice Exam for:\n640-802 - Cisco Certified Network Associate Exam\nWe've partnered with TranscenderÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, the leading exam simulation provider in the world!
