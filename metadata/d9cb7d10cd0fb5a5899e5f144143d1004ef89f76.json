In this unique book, David Wells explores the fascinating connections between games and mathematics, proving that mathematics is not just about tedious calculation but imagination, insight and intuition. The first part of the book introduces games, puzzles and mathematical recreations, including knight tours on a chessboard. The second part explains how thinking about playing games can mirror the thinking of a mathematician, using scientific investigation, tactics and strategy, and sharp observation. Finally the author considers game-like features found in a wide range of human behaviours, illuminating the role of mathematics and helping to explain why it exists at all. This thought-provoking book is perfect for anyone with a thirst for mathematics and its hidden beauty; a good high school grounding in mathematics is all the background that is required, and the puzzles and games will suit pupils from 14 years.\n\n2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9cb7d10cd0fb5a5899e5f144143d1004ef89f76","amp;dn":"Games+and+Mathematics%3A+Subtle+Connections+%282013%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9cb7d10cd0fb5a5899e5f144143d1004ef89f76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,203,125,16,205,15,181,165,137,158,95,20,65,67,209,0,78,248,159,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
