He references a stunning variety of texts (from Freud and Allport to Karen Armstrong and Paul Tillich) reflecting the evolution of these ideas over the decades, to emphasize both the complexity of the issues and the enduring lack of easy answers. The eloquence of the writing and passionate objectivity of the argument will interest readers on all sides of the debate as the author examines: the religious origins of psychology, the original dichotomy: mythos versus logos, the authenticity of religious experience, Religion and personality, the problematic role of prayer and Religion in the history of psychotherapy.\nFor those making a serious study of the history of psychology, Psychology, Religion, and the Nature of the Soul will inspire a fresh wave of critical discussion and inquiry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b1acdcff8d45d12c3ac4a9a21c7d4f45d3fcd0c","amp;dn":"Psychology%2C+Religion%2C+and+the+Nature+of+the+Soul+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b1acdcff8d45d12c3ac4a9a21c7d4f45d3fcd0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,26,205,207,248,212,93,18,195,172,74,154,33,199,212,244,93,63,205,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
