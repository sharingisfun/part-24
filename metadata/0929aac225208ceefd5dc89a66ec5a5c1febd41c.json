Winner of the Gold Crown Award &quot;Best Screenplay&quot; 2001. About a dishonest used car salesman who turns himself around.\n\nThe story is about a used car dealer who fits the cliches about that line of work just perfectly. Then one day his conscience starts to nudge him toward a more honest life. He turns his business over to God, and says that since it belongs to Him, He's now responsible for how his new honest approach turns out.\n\nRuntime: 119 min\nLanguage: English (No-Subtitles)\nYear: 2005\nMy Rating: 9/10\nQuality: 6.0/10\n\nIf financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films in business. If Christians won't buy Christian films then who will?\n\nPlease seed. Let each one of us who call ourself Christians seed 2-3 movies each.
