Higdon, bassist Jonathan Mobley, and drummer Ben Lord formed Elliott after the breakup of their previous band, Falling Forward. After releasing the In Transit EP with Initial Records in 1996, Kevin Ratterman replaced Lord and Empathy's Jay Palumbo came aboard. Elliott made its full-length debut with U.S. Songs on Revelation Records two years later. The band then recorded another EP with each label, with each cover showing a band member jumping off a cliff. After touring tirelessly around the U.S. and releasing False Cathedral in the summer of 2000, Mobley and Palumbo took their leave. Benny Clark (the Loved) took over lead guitar and Jason Skaggs (Eleven Eleven) became the new bassist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cb663d4198b2097d3a35b365ba297dbb1d4dbc3","amp;dn":"Elliott+-+Discography+%281998-2005%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cb663d4198b2097d3a35b365ba297dbb1d4dbc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,182,99,212,25,139,32,151,211,163,91,54,91,162,151,219,177,212,219,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
