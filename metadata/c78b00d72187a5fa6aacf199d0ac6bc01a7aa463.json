This wise and profound book has provided thousands of readers with an answerÃ¢â‚¬â€and has helped them to apply it to their own lives.Far too many of us had to learn as children to hide our own feelings, needs, and memories skillfully in order to meet our parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ expectations and win their Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Alice Miller writes, Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½When I used the word Ã¢â‚¬â„¢giftedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in the title, I had in mind neither children who receive high grades in school nor children talented in a special way. I simply meant all of us who have survived an abusive childhood thanks to an ability to adapt even to unspeakable cruelty by becoming numbÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Without this Ã¢â‚¬â„¢giftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ offered us by nature, we would not have survived.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But merely surviving is not enough. The Drama of the Gifted Child helps us to reclaim our life by discovering our own crucial needs and our own truth.\n(Amazon.com)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c78b00d72187a5fa6aacf199d0ac6bc01a7aa463","amp;dn":"The+Drama+of+the+Gifted+Child+by+Alice+Miller+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c78b00d72187a5fa6aacf199d0ac6bc01a7aa463","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,139,0,215,33,135,165,250,106,172,241,153,208,172,107,192,26,122,164,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
