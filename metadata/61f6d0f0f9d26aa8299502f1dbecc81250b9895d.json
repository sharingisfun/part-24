Eric also admits his own interest in death, confessing to Billy that he spent over three years trying to write a Broadway musical about it. The pair also talk about plans for their own funerals.\nEric said: &quot;IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m paying for fireworks for mine, because I know they are very popular which means that you have to have an evening gig.&quot;\nBilly added: &quot;IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m paying for drugs for mine, because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re very popular too!&quot;\nThe pair discuss what song Eric will have played at his own memorial since his song Always Look on The Bright Side of Life is one of the most requested at funerals. Eric concedes it would have to be that song and the pair launch into a unique rendition together.\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8ac7ebe3e4cac6b9a4ba&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo: Bitrate: 1929 Kbps\nVideo: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\nVideo: Resolution: 832 x 468\nAudio: Codec: AAC LC \nAudio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio: Channels: stereo (2/0) \nAudio: English \nRun-Time: 45mins\nFramerate: 25fps\nNumber of Parts: 2\nPart Size: average 628 MB\nContainer: Mp4\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-03-04/billy-connolly-to-share-plans-for-his-own-funeral-in-new-itv-series&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-03-04/billy-connolly-to-share-plans-for-his-own-funeral-in-new-itv-series&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f6d0f0f9d26aa8299502f1dbecc81250b9895d","amp;dn":"ITV.Billy.Connollys.Big.Send.Off.2of2.PDTV.x264.AAC..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61f6d0f0f9d26aa8299502f1dbecc81250b9895d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,246,208,240,249,210,106,168,41,149,2,241,219,236,200,18,80,185,137,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
