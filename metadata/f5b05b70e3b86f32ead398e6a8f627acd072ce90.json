Quick casual game play combined with the challenge of continuously adapting enemies allow for a surprisingly challenging exercise in strategy. It is a cross breed between a board game and a classic RTS. If you like Risk or 8 Minute Empire, Tenshu General is your game.\r\n\r\nSet in medieval Japan, you will take on the role of a Tenshu General tasked with defending your Tenshu castle against invaders while expanding your own territory. Can you beat the general of the enemy Tenshu at his game?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5b05b70e3b86f32ead398e6a8f627acd072ce90","amp;dn":"Tenshu+General+v1.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5b05b70e3b86f32ead398e6a8f627acd072ce90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,176,91,112,227,184,111,50,234,211,152,230,168,246,39,172,208,114,206,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
