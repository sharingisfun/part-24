Elewa, &quot;Morphometrics for Nonmorphometricians&quot; \n Publisher: Springer | ISBN: 3540958525 | edition 2010 | PDF | 367 pages | 3.96 mb\n\n Morphometrics is concerned with the study of variations and change in the form (size and shape) of organisms or objects adding a quantitative element to descriptions and thereby facilitating the comparison of different objects and organisms. This volume provides an introduction to morphometrics in a clear and simple way without recourse to complex mathematics and statistics. This introduction is followed by a series of case studies describing the variety of applications of morphometrics from paleontology and evolutionary ecology to archaeological artifacts analysis. This is followed by a presentation of future applications of morphometrics and state of the art software for analyzing and comparing shape.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ef62194e1297cdb3f6f103f5d4311c8c8f8d0bb","amp;dn":"Morphometrics+for+Nonmorphometricians","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ef62194e1297cdb3f6f103f5d4311c8c8f8d0bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,246,33,148,225,41,124,219,63,111,16,63,93,67,17,200,200,248,208,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
