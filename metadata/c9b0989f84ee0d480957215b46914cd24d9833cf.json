Plenty of topical and amazing gags, several arguments about football, some fairly merciless banter, a chat about all the funny and crazy things youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen and done that week Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and of course, a frank discussion about the beauty and general awesomeness of women. Fortunately, such a magazine exists. ZOO, the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best selling menÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s weekly magazine, is all about the things that bring men together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all those things that we are proud to say make us normal blokes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9b0989f84ee0d480957215b46914cd24d9833cf","amp;dn":"ZOO+Magazine+UK+-+21+February+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9b0989f84ee0d480957215b46914cd24d9833cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,176,152,159,132,238,13,72,9,87,33,91,70,145,76,210,77,152,51,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
