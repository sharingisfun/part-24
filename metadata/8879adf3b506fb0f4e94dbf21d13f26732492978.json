Where the Pistols were nihilistic, the Clash were fiery and idealistic, charged with righteousness and a leftist political ideology. From the outset, the band was more musically adventurous, expanding its hard rock &amp; roll with reggae, dub, and rockabilly among other roots musics. Furthermore, they were blessed with two exceptional songwriters in Joe Strummer and Mick Jones, each with a distinctive voice and style. The Clash copped heavily from classic outlaw imagery, positioning themselves as rebels with a cause. As a result, they won a passionately devoted following on both sides of the Atlantic. While they became rock &amp; roll heroes in the U.K., second only to the Jam in terms of popularity, it took the Clash several years to break into the American market, and when they finally did in 1982, they imploded several months later. Though the Clash never became the superstars they always threatened to become, they restored passion and protest to rock &amp; roll. For a while, they really did seem like &quot;the only band that mattered.&quot; \n\n\nGenre................: Alternative Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Epic\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.White Riot (Single Version)\n02.1977\n03.London's Burning\n04.Complete Control\n05.Clash City Rockers (Original Version)\n06.I'm So Bored With The U.S.A.\n07.Career Opportunities\n08.Hate &amp; War\n09.Cheat\n10.Police &amp; Thieves\n11.Janie Jones\n12.Garageland\n13.Capital Radio One\n14.(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\n15.English Civil War\n16.Tommy Gun\n17.Safe European Home\n18.Julie's Been Working For The Drug Squad\n19.Stay Free\n20.Groovy Times\n21.I Fought The Law\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.London Calling\n02.The Guns Of Brixton\n03.Clampdown\n04.Rudie Can't Fail\n05.Lost In The Supermarket\n06.Jimmy Jazz\n07.Train In Vain\n08.Bankrobber\n09.The Magnificent Seven\n10.Ivan Meets G.I.
