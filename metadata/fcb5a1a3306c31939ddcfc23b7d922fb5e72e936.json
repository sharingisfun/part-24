Blest roams the \nNew York streets, spraying graffiti wherever he can and dodging angry shop \nowners as he steals spray paint from hardware stores. The art world tugs at \nBlest's sleeve as he slowly makes a name for himself, with several galleries \ninterested in displaying his work, but he has more pressing concerns as one \nof his gang, Lune (Jade Yorker), winds up in jail. Discovering Lune has been \nbadly beaten by the cops, Blest instructs his gang to cover the city with \ngraffiti, starting a deadly running battle with the cops. A movie that \nhighlights how difficult it is for many youngsters to escape the impoverished \nbackgrounds they grew up in, Lough's film is also an interesting look at graffiti \nculture and the talented characters who love to decorate New York with their work.\n\n\n\n\n- Name: Bomb.The.System.2002.Part1.DvDRiP.h.264.AAC-SCUM.m4v\n- Size: 702.2 MiB\n- Duration: 0:44:4\n- Bitrate: 2 228 Kbps\n\n*** Video Track Parameters ***\n- Format: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\n- Size: 568 MiB (81%)\n- FourCC: H264\n- Bitrate: Max.: Undefined\nAverage: 1 801 Kbps\nMin.: Undefined\n- Frame rate (fps): Max.: 29.970\nAverage: 24.167\nMin.: 13.316\n- Resolution: 24 bits\n- Width (Pixel number): 720\n- Height (Pixel number): 464\n- Encoding library: x264 core 79 r1347 5ddd61b\n\n*** First Audio Track Parameters ***\n- Format: AAC - MPEG-4 audio\n- Size: 72.6 MiB (10%)\n- FourCC: 0x28\n- Details: -\n- Bitrate: 230 Kbps\n- Bitrate mode: Variable\n- Resolution: 16 bits\n- Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\n\n\n*** General Parameters ***\n- Name: Bomb.The.System.2002.Part2.DvDRiP.h.264.AAC-SCUM.m4v\n- Size: 702.1 MiB\n- Duration: 0:47:8\n- Bitrate: 2 082 Kbps\n\n*** Video Track Parameters ***\n- Format: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\n- Size: 558 MiB (80%)\n- FourCC: H264\n- Bitrate: Max.: Undefined\nAverage: 1 656 Kbps\nMin.: Undefined\n- Frame rate (fps): Max.: 29.970\nAverage: 24.317\nMin.: 13.316\n- Resolution: 24 bits\n- Width (Pixel number): 720\n- Height (Pixel number): 464\n- Encoding library: x264 core 79 r1347 5ddd61b\n\n*** First Audio Track Parameters ***\n- Format: AAC - MPEG-4 audio\n- Size: 77.6 MiB (11%)\n- FourCC: 0x28\n- Details: -\n- Bitrate: 230 Kbps\n- Bitrate mode: Variable\n- Resolution: 16 bits\n- Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\n\nNotes: SCUM is back to m4v.
