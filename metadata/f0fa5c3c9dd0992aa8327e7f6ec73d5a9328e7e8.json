This collection is the most we have ever been able to dig up, but I fear that the early strips in english might be lost, unless the syndicates change their business model :thumbsdown:\n\n\nPiranha Club is the title of a comic strip written and illustrated by Bud Grace. It was originally called Ernie, but the title was changed to the current one in 1998. The club is meant as a parody on Lions Club International, and the strip made its debut in February 1988.\n\nThe strip is drawn in detail and appears in color. While the strip is usually stand alone, on many occasions it is serialized with the story running for a week or more on some occasions. The daily strip usually runs to four panels. The Sunday strip is in a three-by-three panel format with the strip logo appearing in the top left panel.\n\nHere is a few select strips, featuring some of the regular cast:\n\n\nThe Piranha Club, a group shot of one of their most sacred rituals: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/2765/piranhaclub20010513.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/2765/piranhaclub20010513.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSid Fernwilter, Ernies uncle and member of the Piranha Club, is a hustler who will do just about anything to make a quick buck when hes not trying to scam a few dollars from his nephew or mooch a free meal from Effie.
