Clearly they fail to see the bigger picture of what I am trying to achieve here.  It does nothing more than make me question if I am in fact doing the right thing with these torrents.  And furthermore to that, it makes me wonder if I want to continue my efforts here on The Pirate Bay.\n\nI will not willingly allow myself to be yoked with the misguided and self-centered thinking of such individuals.  I share in several places online.  Many are in a more controlled environment than a public torrent tracker such as this.  Perhaps I should be spending more time there, and less time here.\n\nI've long said that it was my prayer these torrents would be a blessing to those who download it.  That a conscious and righteous Christian would use these albums to &quot;sample&quot; the music, not &quot;side step&quot; their moral obligation of doing the right thing.  And make no mistake about it, the right thing is nothing short of supporting the Artists, putting food on their families table, and thereby allowing them to continue with their ministry.  The right thing is nothing short of &quot;if you like it, buy it.&quot;  The right thing is nothing short of glorifying God in all that He touches, and all that He blesses, including the talents of these faithful Artists making these albums year after year.\n\nI guess I could resample all of these albums down to 128 kbps.  Maybe then, those individuals would rethink their Christian attitudes.  And if I did, it would actually serve me a whole better as I would be able to jam a lot more than 25 or 30 albums per bundle.  Thereby meaning I would be bundling less, and using far less of my time and effort here on The Pirate Bay.  It would free up some time for me to share elsewhere.\n\nBundle 34 includes the following 27 releases..
