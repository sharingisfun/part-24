It was popularly nicknamed &quot;balalaika&quot;, from the aircraft's planform-view resemblance to the Russian stringed musical instrument or oÃ…â€šÃƒÂ³wek (English: pencil) by Polish pilots due to the shape of its fuselage.\n\nEarly versions are considered second-generation jet fighters, while later versions are considered to be third-generation jet fighters. Some 50 countries over four continents have flown the MiG-21, and it still serves many nations a half-century after its maiden flight. The fighter made aviation records. At least by name, it is the most-produced supersonic jet aircraft in aviation history and the most-produced combat aircraft since the Korean War, and it had the longest production run of a combat aircraft (1959 to 1985 over all variants).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32c21cdaaf5f26607cfe4759b185b77149c3ba2f","amp;dn":"MiG-21+Library","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32c21cdaaf5f26607cfe4759b185b77149c3ba2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,194,28,218,175,95,38,96,124,254,71,89,177,133,183,113,73,195,186,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
