Over 9 hours long, the film consists of three parts, &quot;Rust,&quot; &quot;Remnants&quot; and &quot;Rails.&quot;\nTie Xi Qu was filmed over the course of two years between 1999 and 2001[1] and details the slow decline of Shenyang's industrial Tiexi district, an area that was once a vibrant example of China's socialist economy. With the move towards other industries, however, the factories of Tiexi have all begun to be closed down, and with them, much of the district's worker-based infrastructure and social constructs.\n\nThe English subtitle &quot;West of the Tracks&quot; is a literal translation of &quot;Tiexi.&quot;\n\nContents \n1 Plot\n1.1 &quot;Rust&quot;\n1.2 &quot;Remnants&quot;\n1.3 &quot;Rails&quot;\n2 See also\n3 References\n4 External links\n[\n&quot;Rust&quot;\nThe first portion, &quot;Rust&quot; follows a group of factory workers in three state-run factories: a smelting plant, an electric cable factory and a sheet metal factory. Workers at all three face sub-standard equipment, hazardous waste, and lack of safety precautions. Perhaps even worse, with the declining need for such heavy industry, the factories also face a constant lack of raw materials, leaving the workers idle and concerned for their future.\n\n&quot;Remnants&quot;\nThe second part, &quot;Remnants&quot; follows the families of many of the workers in an old state-run housing block, &quot;Rainbow Row.&quot; In particular, Wang focuses on the teenage children who concern themselves with their own lives but must also cope with their inevitable displacement as Tie Xi's factories continue to close down.\n\n&quot;Rails&quot;\nThe third part, &quot;Rails&quot; narrows its focus to a single father and son who scavenge the rail yards in order to sell raw parts to the factories. With the factories closing however, their future suddenly becomes uncertain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:290bbcabc6752a2cec8d119f8e0ad45a0c41eafe","amp;dn":"%E9%93%81%E8%A5%BF%E5%8C%BA++-+West+of+the+Tracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"290bbcabc6752a2cec8d119f8e0ad45a0c41eafe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,11,188,171,198,117,42,44,236,141,17,159,142,10,212,90,12,65,234,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
