He has also handled lead vocals for Mr. Bungle (which preceded his involvement with FNM), Tomahawk, Lovage, FantÃƒÂ´mas, The Dillinger Escape Plan, and Peeping Tom.\n\nPatton has a wide range of vocal techniques and styles. He also uses rhythm as a driving force and tool in many of his vocals. He sings in several different styles, from falsetto to rapping, beatboxing and scatting. Critic Greg Prato writes, &quot;Patton could very well be one of the most versatile and talented singers in rock music.&quot;[1] His vocal techniques can also be witnessed in the 2007 first-person shooter, The Darkness. He also has a cameo as the &quot;Anger Sphere&quot; in Portal, and will be the voice of protagonist Nathan Spence in the upcoming Bionic Commando remake.[2]\n\nHe often produces side projects in collaboration with other musicians, such as John Zorn, Dan the Automator, The Melvins, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Melt-Banana, Sepultura, Merzbow, Kool Keith, The X-Ecutioners, Team Sleep, BjÃƒÂ¶rk, Subtle, Rahzel, Amon Tobin, Eyvind Kang, Lovage, and Kaada. He co-founded Ipecac Recordings with Greg Werckman in 1999, and has run the label since.\n\nPatton&amp;#039;s right hand is permanently numb from an on-stage incident during his third concert with Faith No More, where he accidentally cut himself on a broken bottle and severed the tendons and nerves in his hand. He can use his hand, but he has no feeling in it (much to the surprise of both Patton and his doctor, who told him the exact opposite would happen).[3]\n[/quote]\n\nPack includes - \nFaith no more - Introduce yourself\nFaith no more - The real thing\nFaith no more - Live at Brixton academy\nFaith no more - Angel Dust\nFaith no more - King for a day fool for a lifetime\nFaith no more - Album of the year\nFaith no more - Bsides\nFaith no more - Fools small victorys rarities and b-sides 90-95\nFantomas - Delirium cordia\nFantomas - Fantomas\nFantomas - The directors cut\nFantomas - Suspended anmation\nGeneral Patton vs The Xecutioners\nHemophiliac - Zorn, mori and Patton\nLovage - Songs to make love to your old lady by\nMike Patton - Adult themes for voice\nMike Patton - Pranzo oltransista\nMike Patton and Kaada - Romances\nMr Bungle - California\nMr Bungle - Disco volante\nMr Bungle - Mr Bungle\nPeeping Tom - Peeping Tom\nTomahawk - Mit Gas\nTomahawk - Tomahawk\nVarious Bitrates.\n\nPlease help seeding this thing its pretty big and I havent got the fastest connection.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c9d53bada35a58382378f8ff5a48bd827d0e918","amp;dn":"Mike+Patton+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c9d53bada35a58382378f8ff5a48bd827d0e918","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,157,83,186,218,53,165,131,130,55,143,143,245,164,139,216,39,208,233,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
