After discovering a love of the harmonica and blues music, he turned his attention in that direction. In 1995, Ricci moved from Portland to Memphis, TN, where shortly there after he placed first in the Sonny Boy Blues Society contest at 21 years of age. Later that same year Ricci recorded his first album 'Jason Ricci'. In 1997 Jason released his second album for Billy Gibson's North Magnolia Music label 'Down at The Juke' largely inspired by the North Mississippi sound and some years earlier than the North Mississippi Al Stars formation.\nBlues, Rock, Funk, Jazz Fusion, Eastern, Punk, Psychedelic, Carnival, Performance Art and more are all regularly attached descriptions of the Jason Ricci &amp; his band's music. Jason Ricci plays music beyond musical category, adhering to no rules or genres restrictions, fusing the forces of good and evil, light and dark and positive and negative into an alchemy of spirit evoking, musical sorcery that stirs emotions, provokes thought, bends will and channels demons and angels nightly before falling asleep unafraid next to black wooden gargoyles dug up from the cold ground.\n\nTracklist\n\n01.
