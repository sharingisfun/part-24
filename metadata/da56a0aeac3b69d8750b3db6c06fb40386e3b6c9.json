Thi is their third studio album from 1970.\n\n\nSwedish psych/prog/jazz outfit rooted in the mid 1960's underground. Unusually for a band with such a name they were fronted by Polish ex-pat George Wadenius whose unique guitar style was key to their sound. The original trio format made 3 studio albums and a live album (plus contributions to a soundtrack work) before splitting up. All 3 members then joined Solar Plexus (9) (not at the same time). The reformation in the mid-1970's was more of a super-group also involving musicians from Finland.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da56a0aeac3b69d8750b3db6c06fb40386e3b6c9","amp;dn":"Made+In+Sweden+-+Made+In+England+%281970%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da56a0aeac3b69d8750b3db6c06fb40386e3b6c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,86,160,174,172,59,105,216,117,11,61,182,192,111,180,3,134,227,182,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
