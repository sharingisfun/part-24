The New Underworld Order is a world in which official criminality, driven by bribery and corruption, is the norm among all layers of governance. At the vast intergovernmental level, the Rule of Law does not apply - a state of affairs which is exploited to the full under cover of a facade of hypocritical official rectitude. But at the country level, it is ruthlessly relied upon by corrupt intelligence cadres when it suits their interests - and equally ruthlessly flouted by operatives and officials most of the time, on the cynical basis that &amp;#039;everyone is doing it&amp;#039;. In particular, &amp;#039;everyone&amp;#039; is engaged in perpetrating crimes against humanity - in the form of drug-trafficking operations, which are controlled by the competing and simultaneously collaborating intelligence services of the Great Powers in order to finance their corrupt operations, and to sustain the corrosive and subversive global hegemony activities of the llluminati, of which intelligence communities form, wittingly or unwittingly, the backbone, as they consist essentially of esoteric secret societies. What this means is that governments, and the revolutionary New World Order cabal seeking global governance (or control), are increasingly in the hands of criminal gangs and corrupt power cliques that hide behind formal government positions. Many of the the main Illuminati figures on the world stage today are compromised or vulnerable to blackmail and other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Black OpsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ forms of control. During the giga-fund-raising operation, truly unbelievable sums of money were stolen, misrouted or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“misappropriatedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Indeed, the ransacking and pillaging that took place was so colossal, and the impasse while this was occurring so extended (in 1989-91), that the international banking and financial systems nearly collapsed. Other funding resources resulting from creative Financial Warfare and scamming operations are hidden in accounts held by offshore corporations controlled by international intelligence, which is extensively criminalised and thus increasingly engaged in mafia-style global ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“gangland warfareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. StoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sensational new expose provides chapter and verse on the dark forces behind the New Underworld Order, gives detailed financial audit trails showing where and how colossal sums have vanished, identifies the international institutions that have had their trust abused by globalist criminalists or have themselves been corrupted by them, shows how secret Financial Warfare operations and scams conducted by the Great Powers are driving the world to catastrophe, and generally lifts the veil covering the global financial intelligence war which the pressured ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“mainstreamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ media declines to monitor and report. Exposure of these matters is obviously overdue and this study performs this needed forensic function, revealing dark actors playing games as it&amp;#039;s chiefly about the rampant global corruption in high places arising from the free-wheeling, unrestrained abominations of the system of synarchy - rule by secret societies. Mammoth in size and extremely well documented, this explosive book connects not only the dots between apparently independent events but brings to light the hidden history and philosophy of the global underworld elites, especially in recent turbulent times when the enemy of communism was silently replaced by international terrorism which now continues the dialectical game that has been played for so long. Prepare for nothing less than a tour-de-force of events, methods and people that have brought into being the triumph of criminalism that we witness all around us. One of those rare books that more than successfully proves that all major governments, banking institutions and intelligence services of the world have been silently working together for the whole time while the stupid masses continue to believe they are at war or there is a &amp;#039;conflict of interests&amp;#039;. 750 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5fbeed431b8dc7d6a3b7cde622127504378f6a","amp;dn":"Story-New+Underworld+Order%28mammoth+expose+of+New+World+Order%29%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5fbeed431b8dc7d6a3b7cde622127504378f6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,95,190,237,67,27,141,199,214,163,183,205,230,34,18,117,4,55,143,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
