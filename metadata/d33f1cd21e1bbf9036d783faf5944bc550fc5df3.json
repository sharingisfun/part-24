With its touches of banjo, flashes of wry humor, and more sprightly tempos -- all attributes heard to good effect on the sardonic road diary &quot;Asleep at the Wheel&quot; -- Worse for the Wear is the most relaxed-sounding and brightest New Amsterdams record yet, and with songs as catchy as &quot;The Spoils of the Spoiled,&quot; and the oddly '70s rock piano-based tune, &quot;From California,&quot; the New Amsterdams are in danger of taking over from the Get Up Kids as Pryor's most interesting and memorable band.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d33f1cd21e1bbf9036d783faf5944bc550fc5df3","amp;dn":"The+New+Amsterdams+-+Worse+for+the+Wear+%282003%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d33f1cd21e1bbf9036d783faf5944bc550fc5df3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,63,28,210,30,27,191,144,54,215,131,250,245,148,75,197,80,252,93,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
