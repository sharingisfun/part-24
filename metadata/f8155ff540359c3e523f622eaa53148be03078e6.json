Unfortunately, with direct deposit and debit cards that work like cash, it's nearly impossible to do today. MoneyWell supercharges that concept and gives you back control over your spending with spending buckets.\n\nFind What You're Looking For Quickly\n\nSee all your dining out transactions in the last three months with a couple of clicks in the Filters popover. What if you knew the entry had the word &quot;apple&quot; in it? Just type &quot;apple&quot; in Search Transactions and instantly see the results before you finish typing. Save your favorite searches with our Smart Filters.\n\nBest-In-Class Currency Support\n\nEach transaction stores three amounts, each with its own currency. Purchase using GBP for a EUR account and track your spending in a USD bucket. MoneyWell automatically looks up the correct exchange rate and sets the amounts, but you have full control to change any of them.\n\nDirect Connect Banking\n\nMoneyWell allows you to directly talk to hundreds of banks and other financial institutions giving you one-click access to your accounts. Setting up direct connect banking with MoneyWell is a breeze too. Simply follow the built-in guide that steps you through selecting your financial institution, entering your login information, and adding your accounts.\n\nFor those banks that don't support direct connections, MoneyWell still makes it easy to avoid manual entries by allowing you to import common file formats like OFX, QFX, QIF, and CSV.\n\nDropbox Sync with MoneyWell for iPhone\n\nSecurely sync your MoneyWell data from anywhere you have access to the internet. Now you can take MoneyWell with you when you shop. MoneyWell for Mac syncs with MoneyWell for iPhone, so you can check to make sure you have money in your Entertainment bucket balance before you buy that movie ticket. Pull to sync on your iPhone and you Mac is immediately updated with your new transactions. And don't worry about prying eyes, you supply a password that encrypts your data during transmission and while stored on Dropbox.\n\nLegendary Support\n\nNo Thirst Software is proud of its reputation for timely support and we will do whatever it takes to keep that reputation shiny. Support is fast, free and just a click away!\n\n\n\nRequirements: OS X 10.7 or later, 64-bit processor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8155ff540359c3e523f622eaa53148be03078e6","amp;dn":"MoneyWell+2.1+%28Mac+App+Store%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8155ff540359c3e523f622eaa53148be03078e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,21,95,245,64,53,156,62,82,63,98,46,170,83,20,139,224,48,120,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
