Yes it's ultra clean, but also very cool. In particular the guitar solo he lays down on the track &quot;Sun Down&quot; still amazes me - after listening to it for 30 years. ~ &quot;Rice Burner 2000&quot;, Amazon.com\n\nWes Montgomery's last album for Verve (other than an exciting collaboration with Jimmy Smith) is a so-so orchestral date featuring arrangements by Don Sebesky. The material (which includes &quot;Sunny&quot; and &quot;California Dreaming&quot;) is strictly pop fluff of the era and the great guitarist has little opportunity to do much other than state the melody in his trademark octaves. This record was perfect for AM radio of the period.  ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nAs Wes Montgomery sailed into ever-poppier waters towards the end of his career, two things remained constant: he kept writing and including original tunes on his albums, and he kept playing and including the blues in one shade or another. Thus, on CALIFORNIA DREAMING, another big band-orchestrated Verve album, we get &quot;Sun Down,&quot; a six-minute original blues, cut for the most part with just the first-call rhythm section of Herbie Hancock, Richard Davis, Grady Tate and Ray Baretto. The other original, &quot;Mr. Walker,&quot; is just as cooking, and dates from Montgomery's second Riverside album, the aptly titled INCREDIBLE JAZZ GUITAR OF WES MONTGOMERY.\n\nCALIFORNIA DREAMING, unlike BUMPIN', emphasizes groove tunes over ballads, and keeps the pop challenges to a minimum. It's not the relentless cooking of SMOKIN' AT THE HALF NOTE, or the aforementioned INCREDIBLE JAZZ GUITAR, but it's solid Montgomery nonetheless. ~ CDUniverse\n\nPersonnel:\nWes Montgomery (guitar);\nDon Sebesky (arranger, conductor);\nJack Jennings (vibraphone, percussion);\nHerbie Hancock (piano);\nAl Casamenti, Buck Pizzarelli (guitar);\nRichard Davis (bass);\nGrady Tate (drums);\nRay Baretto (percussion)\n\nWes Montgomery - California Dreaming Tracks:\n01  California Dreaming (John Phillips) 3:08 \n02  Sun Down (Wes Montgomery) 6:03 \n03  Oh You Crazy Moon (Johnny Burke/James Van Heusen) 3:44 \n04  More, More, Amor (Sol Lake) 2:54 \n05  Without You (Rinaldo Marino/Walter Myers) 3:05 \n06  Winds Of Barcelona (Sol Lake) 3:07 \n07  Sunny (Bobby Hebb) 4:04 \n08  Green Papers (Sol Lake) 2:56 \n09  Mr. Walker (Wes Montgomery) 3:39 \n10  South Of The Border (Michael Carr/Jimmy Kennedy) 3:13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40478e645a106ff4ab48bac63a38d457cb64ead8","amp;dn":"Wes+Montgomery+-+California+Dreaming+%281966%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bschon55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40478e645a106ff4ab48bac63a38d457cb64ead8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,71,142,100,90,16,111,244,171,72,186,198,58,56,212,87,203,100,234,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
