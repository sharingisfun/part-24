The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.\n\nOn the May 6 Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex takes a look at the phony 9/11 Gitmo show trial of supposed master terrorist Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and his four co-defendants. On Saturday, the arraignment of the accused terrorists turned into a three ring circus, thus sending the message that the Sixth Amendment is irrelevant in terrorist cases. Alex also covers the massive police state rollout in Chicago as the NATO war council prepares to convene. He also adds new details on draconian re-education camps where political activists will be forced to appreciate the murderous foreign policy of the ruling elite.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
