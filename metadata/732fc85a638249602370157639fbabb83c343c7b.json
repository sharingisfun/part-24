Fans of this show will really enjoy this episode because 1) they're using trap cameras! 2) Ranae makes her very first a 'Squatch call! 3) Bobo continues his comedic remedies, and 4) their last night of investigation turns the very skeptical Ranae into a bit more of a believer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:732fc85a638249602370157639fbabb83c343c7b","amp;dn":"Finding.Bigfoot.S02E01.Birth.of.a.Legend.HDTV.XviD-tNe.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"732fc85a638249602370157639fbabb83c343c7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,47,200,90,99,130,73,96,35,112,21,118,57,251,171,184,60,52,60,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
