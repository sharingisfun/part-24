A MUST for any collector!\nThere are two minor discrepancies in the song lists from those of my low generation tapes of these same shows. The CD notes that Light My Fire was only performed on the 7th. My tapes show this same version performed on the 10th, not the 7th. And the two different versions of The End that were performed on both nights are switched.\nNevertheless, this CD book/box set is the classiest bootleg set I've seen. Don't miss it!\n\n-----------------\n\nThe actual set lists are a bit different than the ones on this release. I included 2 jpg scans (+ the covers in the rar) from Greg Shaw's The Doors on the Road book regarding these gigs. So check that out and compare it to the set lists down below.\n\nHere's the track listing (as on the cd's):\n\n\nTuesday 7th March 1967\nSet 1:\n\n  1. Backdoor Man\n  2. My Eyes Have Seen you\n  3. Soul Kitchen\n  4. Get Off My Life\n  5. When The Music's Over\n  6. Close To You\n  7. Crawling King Snake\n  8. I Can't See Your Face In My Mind\n  9. People Are Strange\n10. Who Do You Love?\n11. Alabama Song\n12. The Crystal Ship\n\nSet 2:\n\n1. Twentieth Century Fox\n2. Moonlight Drive\n3. Summer's Almost Gone\n4. Unhappy Girl\n5. Woman\n6. Break On Through\n7. Light My Fire\n8. The End\n\nFriday 10th March 1967\nSet 1:\n\n1. My Eyes have Seen You\n2. Soul Kitchen\n3. I Can't See Your Face In My Mind\n4. People Are Strange\n5. When The Music's Over\n6. Money\n7. Who Do You Love?\n8. Moonlight Drive\n\nSet 2:\n\n1. Summer's Almost Gone\n2. I'm A King Bee\n3. Gloria\n4. Break On Through\n5. Summertime\n6. Backdoor Man\n7. Alabama Song\n8. The End\n\nThere are some of my absolute favorite tracks played live here, like My Eyes Have Seen You, I Can't See Your Face In My Mind, Unhappy Girl, Summer's Almost Gone and Summertime.\n\nHelp me seed this one and the ones I posted earlier. I will be on a journey for a few days starting tomorrow so I cannot guarantee that my computer stays on all the time. \n\nMP3 VBR\nAudiograbber 1.82\nLAME 3.93","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dc95fe761d7eef5ceca46af83fcfed69326f3cb","amp;dn":"The+Doors+-+The+Complete+Matrix+Club+Tapes+-+4CD++%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dc95fe761d7eef5ceca46af83fcfed69326f3cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,201,95,231,97,215,238,245,206,202,70,175,131,252,254,214,147,38,243,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
