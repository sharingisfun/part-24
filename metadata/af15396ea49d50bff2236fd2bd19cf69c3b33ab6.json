SethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder, however, puts exactly that into motion.\n\nFrom opposite sides of death, the Castillo twins grapple with a reality neither of them suspected, although it has been encoded in myths and legends for millennia. The Earth we know is just one of many &quot;realms&quot;, three of which are inhabited by humans during various stages of their lives. And their afterlives...\n\nIn the tradition of Philip Pullman and Ursula K. Le Guin and inspired by numerous arcane sources, the Books of the Cataclysm begin in the present world but soon propel the reader to a landscape that is simultaneously familiar and fantastic.\n\nBook 2 Summary:\nIn a remote city on the edge of two worlds, where blood has power and water is more precious than freedom, three far-flung friends unite on a quest to save their families. Sal HrvatiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estranged father has brought more into the world than the woman he loved. Instead of saving her from the Void Beneath, he has summoned an unknown creatureÃ¢â‚¬â€a creature with a mission of its own and a past that stretches back to the beginning of the world. The quest to find both of them entangles Sal and his companions in a hunt for magical treasure on the floor of the Divide, a mighty crack in the earth inhabited by creatures that are not remotely human. Desert landscapes and dirigibles feature in a fast-paced fantasy that combines romance, adventure, and humor with an original take on magic.\nThe Books of the Cataclysm take inspiration from many arcane and mythological sources. In positing that this world is just one of many &quot;realms,&quot; three of which are inhabited by humans during various stages of their lives, it begins in the present world but soon propels the reader to a landscape that is simultaneously familiar and fantastic.\n\nBooks 3 Summary: The Hanging Mountains\nAncient enemies stalk ghostly fog forests as legends come to life and old friends are lost forever ...\n\nThe Divide is flooded, at great cost of human - and inhuman - life. Far from home, Sal, Shilly and Skender seek the source of the deluge in the legendary Hanging Mountains, traveling in a magical ship of bone. New threats await them in the fog forests of the Panic, and new tests of their friendship. Caught in a conflict that erupts between two long-forgotten civilizations, they struggle to discern ally from foe, and to find trust when it is needed most.\n\nIn their wake comes the Homunculus, vessel and prison of the Castillo twins - sole, strange survivors of the catastrophe that changed the world forever, a thousand years ago. Their mission is paramount, their urgency contagious. Something much darker and deadlier than the Swarm is stirring in the heart of the mountains.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af15396ea49d50bff2236fd2bd19cf69c3b33ab6","amp;dn":"Books+of+the+Cataclysm+e-book+collection+by+Sean+Williams+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af15396ea49d50bff2236fd2bd19cf69c3b33ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,21,57,110,164,157,80,191,242,35,111,210,189,25,207,105,195,179,58,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
