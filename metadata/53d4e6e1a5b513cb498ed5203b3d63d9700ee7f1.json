He graduated at London University in 1964 and held junior posts at \nthe London Hospital from that time. In 1970 he joined the Hammersmith Hospital \nas a Registrar and became involved in research and development in \ngynaecological microsurgery. \n\nHe is well known today to audiences throughout the world for his several BBC \ntelevision series, which include The Human Body, Secret Life of Twins and \nSuperhuman, and through which he has shown a great capacity for communicating \noften complex science to a wide public audience. He is Professor of Fertility \nStudies at Imperial College School of Medicine, London University, and is \nworld-renowned as a fertility expert. He also heads the Department of \nReproductive Medicine at the Hammersmith Hospital in London.\n\nIn Human Instints Professor Robert Winston provides a unique insight into what \nit is that makes us human. And it is the story of our extraordinary instincts \nand why we behave the way we do and what other animals reveal about our most \nbasic drives. With intriguing experiments and secret filming he uncovers the \nsurprising science of sex. And helps us understand why one human being could \nlay down their life for another. In exploring survival, sex, competition and \nself-sacrifice, Professor Winston takes viewers on a journey of discovery into \nhuman behaviour, to look at ourselves in an entirely new way. \nHe believes the series is not science for scientists - it is about trying to \ntranslate complex ideas into something easily accessible for all. He thinks \nthe whole area of evolutionary psychology has been largely overlooked but \nthinks it&amp;#039;s fascinating. According to Winston we all carry a prehistoric \nbaggage around with us and don&amp;#039;t have full control over it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart 4:\n\nA 200,000 year old jawbone tells the story of an elderly woman who was kept alive thanks to the kindness of her companions. From this first known example of human compassion to modern day heroes, the final programme in the Human Instinct series explores the most complex of instincts. The instinct to put others first.\n\nBlood Ties\nThe mother?s drive to protect her children is the most powerful heroic instinct we know. Having children is a way of ensuring our genes are passed on to the next generation. Humans usually have just one child at a time, so they are prepared to do virtually anything to ensure their children are safe. But this protective instinct also expands to the rest of our family. And the more genes we share, the more likely we are to put ourselves out for someone.\n\nFast Friends\nBut unlike many animals, humans are also willing to risk everything for people who aren?t related to them. Al Rascon received the medal of honour for his actions in the Vietnam war. He ran into a hail of bullets, risking death, to rescue his injured friend. How has this self-sacrificing instinct evolved?\n\nNatural Born Heroes\nNone of us would hesitate to help someone who has had a bad fall. And it?s this same instinctive reaction which often leads to feats of great heroism. We all feel empathy when we see someone else in trouble, and at the University of Ferrara Luciano Fadiga may have found the reason why. Mirror neurones in our brains may help us mimic the actions and emotions of others.\n\nVampire bats and humans are amongst a handful of animals that display altruistic behaviour. We intuitively pick up others? emotions from the expressions on their faces and our instincts for language mean we can explain ourselves in ways no other animals can. But we are even more than the sum of our instincts. As human beings we learn, we reason and we choose. In the terrible disaster at the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001 two men found they too had the drive to be heroes. Mike Benfante and John Cerqueira helped carry wheelchair bound Tina Hansen to safety. In the midst of the chaos, John and Mike were spurred on by the instincts we all share to help others. But their extraordinary heroism also reveals a strength of character that instinct alone cannot explain.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe file have two audio tracks.
