It has been shown in many countries, including the UK, USA, Japan, Australia etc. Roger is recognised as one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s authorities on cats, and his studies of them in different countries gave the basis for this series which he wrote and presented.\n\nHe took the story of the cat in this 5 part series from its wild ancestors into domestication and its early domestic life and deification in Ancient Egypt, and rediscovered a cat cemetery that had been lost for the last century. He traced the medieval demonisation of the cat in Britain and Europe, its spread around the world with the formation of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAristocatsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the historic breeds such as for example the Siamese and Korat in Thailand. He looked at cat as hunter and the reaction to that in Australia. His series exposed the issue of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdesigner breedsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to a wide public for the first time. The companion book for the series was a best-seller.\n\nRoger also wrote and presented Understanding Cats which was first shown on BBC TV before being shown as Pledge Programming on PBS in the USA, and in other countries.\n\n* Additional information :\n\n- Presenter site notes : http://www.rogertabor.co.uk/showreel.html\n- Wikipedia page : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_in_ancient_Egypt\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13a026c148a9c70b1a9826b69d19b560e963ad32","amp;dn":"Cats+-+Pets+or+Pests%3F+++%28BBC+1991+-+Part+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13a026c148a9c70b1a9826b69d19b560e963ad32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,160,38,193,72,169,199,11,26,152,38,182,157,25,181,96,233,99,173,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
