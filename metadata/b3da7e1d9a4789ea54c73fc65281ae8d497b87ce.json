While she knew she one day wanted to have a career in music, GLORIA GAYNOR still went to school with the aim of having something to fall back on and studied beauty and business courses.\r\n\r\nIn 1965 GLORIA GAYNOR released her first solo single titled Sheâ€™ll Be Sorry with the B-Side Let Me Go Baby on Jocida Records. However, it wasnâ€™t until the 1970â€™s that Gaynor began to taste real success with the release of her first two albums, Experience and Never Can Say Goodbye, (both available on BBR) that she began to stand out as a unique and recognizable force on the black music scene.\r\n\r\nIn 1978 GLORIA GAYNOR released her 5th studio album, PARK AVENUE SOUND on Polydor Records, now fully remastered and repackaged by BBR!\r\n\r\nPARK AVENUE SOUND features some of the best musicians of the time including Keith E. Benson on drums, Norman Harris and Grammy Award Winner Bobby Eli on guitar as well as Grammy Award Winner Ron &quot;Have Mercyâ€ Kersey, who was a member of The Trammps along with Norman Harris.\r\nWhile the album did not produce any chart hits it did produce some extremely popular club tracks including the single, â€˜YOUâ€RE ALL I NEED TO GET BYâ€™, written by Motownâ€™s prolific songwriting duo, Ashford &amp; Simpson and more recently the song was sampled in the Grammy Award winning duet performed by Method Man and Mary J. Blige on the hit single, â€˜I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get Byâ€™. Other notable tracks include the celebrated â€˜THIS LOVE AFFAIRâ€™, which was a long-standing rare groove underground UK hit.\r\n\r\nPark Avenue Sound has since become a cult album for disco and GLORIA GAYNOR fans, having never been released on CD until now!\r\n\r\nBBR couldnâ€™t be happier to present the release of Gloria Gaynor â€“ Park Avenue Sound. Lovingly remastered and repackaged complete with extensive liner notes featuring interviews and added bonus content, this BBR Remaster truly is a must have for all Disco, Soul, Funk and R&amp;B fans out there!\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
