We at Tronik\n    are proud to give you the unmixed version of selected tracks from Sasha\n    and Digweed&amp;#039;s Classic Mix that was Limited Edition in a 4 record set :)\n    These tracks (which I own most of singly), represent what really got me\n    started as an Underground DJ, and are the very essence in the evolution\n    of the Trance and Progressive House styles. As always, Tronik will \n    continue to pursue bringing you the best quality rips and music alike.\n   \n    (Note to other Rippers: It took me 4 days to clean up these tracks,\n     and I thought if it is worth releasing, it is worth the effort to \n     attempt, at least, the removal of any clicks and surface noise. I only \n     hope that others after me will strive to do what they can to improve the\n     quality of vinyl releases in the scene.)             \n                                                                             \n    Enjoy!                                                                   \n                                                                             \n    -MaSSiVDJ-                                                                \n                                                                             \n    It&amp;#039;s all about quality music.
