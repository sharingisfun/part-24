What we have here is a complete collection of the 2006-2008 MTV show Rob &amp; Big, presented in properly cropped DVD-Rips with internal audio commentary and full bonus features included in the two box sets, all uncensored (when applicable), as they were meant to be heard.\n\nThere was a few unavoidable snags in the project. Unfortunately, because of how MTV produced these discs before native widescreen was standardized, they were letterboxed in a 4:3 frame, so some small pixelation is unavoidable, as seen in other ripped versions of the series. Also, I couldn't restore noteworthy original song cues from the original airings (such as the season 3 episode 'Vegas,' where Drama's favorite song, T.I.'s 'What You Know?', is replaced due to licensing problems), due to the only available DSR torrents being long dead.\n\nThis came out so well, I'm gonna take a break for a bit before I start working on a Viva La Bam Ultimate Collection. And I mean, I'll say it once again: It's stupid that people can't rip the commentary tracks and mux it into the MP4 real quick. How hard is it?? Not very...\n\nOtherwise, enjoy, and spread this as much as you can. I imagine this will be a real treat for big fans of the duo.\n\nRob &amp; Big - Ultimate Collection\nVideo: x264 / 640 x 360 / 29.97 FPS\nEpisode Audio: AAC / 48000 Hz / 192 Kbps CBR\nComment Audio: AAC / 48000 Hz / 192 Kbps CBR\n\nSeason 1\n\nS01E01 -- 02/Nov/06 -- Moving In \nS01E02 -- 09/Nov/06 -- Go Skate Day \nS01E03 -- 16/Nov/06 -- Travel \nS01E04 -- 23/Nov/06 -- Let's Get Physical \nS01E05 -- 30/Nov/06 -- Happy Birthday \nS01E06 -- 07/Dec/06 -- Making the House a Home \nS01E07 -- 14/Dec/06 -- Mom for Meaty/Blind Dates \nS01E08 -- 21/Dec/06 -- Do Work \n\nS01 BONUS -- Deleted Scenes\nS01 BONUS -- Interviews\nS01 BONUS -- Skate Tutorials\nS01 BONUS -- Special Meaty Footage\nS01 BONUS -- Rob &amp; Big: The Real Deal\n\nSeason 2\n\nS02E01 -- 22/May/07 -- Meaty &amp; Mini \nS02E02 -- 29/May/07 -- Time Travel \nS02E03 -- 05/Jun/07 -- Mississippi \nS02E04 -- 12/Jun/07 -- Assistant Drama \nS02E05 -- 19/Jun/07 -- Strip Show \nS02E06 -- 26/Jun/07 -- Tampa \nS02E07 -- 03/Jul/07 -- Bobby Light \nS02E08 -- 10/Jul/07 -- New Cars \n\nS02 BONUS -- Deleted Scenes\nS02 BONUS -- 'Dirty Girl' Music Video (Uncensored)\nS02 BONUS -- 'MTV Cribs' Appearance\nS02 BONUS -- Special Mini Footage\nS02 BONUS -- Special Uncle Jerry Footage\nS02 BONUS -- 'The Best of Season 2' Special\n\nSeason 3\n\nS03E01 -- 08/Jan/08 -- Poop in the Pool \nS03E02 -- 15/Jan/08 -- Turtle Racing \nS03E03 -- 22/Jan/08 -- Mini-Horse Road Trip \nS03E04 -- 29/Jan/08 -- Meaty Goes To Hollywood \nS03E05 -- 05/Feb/08 -- Guinness World Records \nS03E06 -- 12/Feb/08 -- Big Bob \nS03E07 -- 19/Feb/08 -- Charity \nS03E08 -- 26/Feb/08 -- Harry the Healer \nS03E09 -- 04/Mar/08 -- Best, Worst and Unused \nS03E10 -- 11/Mar/08 -- Dating Game \nS03E11 -- 18/Mar/08 -- Vegas \nS03E12 -- 25/Mar/08 -- Meaty's Birthday \nS03E13 -- 01/Apr/08 -- Parents \nS03E14 -- 08/Apr/08 -- Cancun \nS03E15 -- 15/Apr/08 -- Haunted House \nS03E16 -- 15/Apr/08 -- Baby \n\nS03 BONUS -- Deleted Scenes\nS03 BONUS -- 'Best, Worst &amp; Unused' Special\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://epguides.com/RobandBig&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://epguides.com/RobandBig&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTorrent Seeding Since 2014.10.02 @ 11:15 AM PT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:592a3e12c720e78ace66f339e48945f4d65d1c32","amp;dn":"Rob.%26amp%3B.Big.Ultimate.Collection.DVDRip.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"592a3e12c720e78ace66f339e48945f4d65d1c32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,42,62,18,199,32,231,138,206,102,243,57,228,137,69,244,214,93,28,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
