Regardless, here it is and, for those of you unfamiliar with &quot;Hitlists&quot;, read on...\n\n\nHitlist breakdowns\n\nEvery week TPB member, shipjolly, uploads several torrents called &quot;Hitlists&quot;. These torrents represent everything that was scanned for that particular week: current, old and OOP. I've found these to be very, VERY helpful in plugging holes in my collection.\n\nThis torrent is an easily searchable .rtf file I created that lists the contents of each of these torrents available on TPB, excluding his separate 'Hitlist Adult' and 'Hitlist Non-English' uploads, from 4/11/12 thru 8/28/13, making it current as of this writing. \n\nTo find these torrents, search for &quot;Hitlist&quot; under &quot;Other&quot;, download what you need and pay it forward by seeding for a spell. \n\nNow everyone say, &quot;Thank you, shipjolly!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f616201c8ef57a0496804f004617102eef1d23bc","amp;dn":"Hitlists+searchable+%28updated%2C+by+request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f616201c8ef57a0496804f004617102eef1d23bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,22,32,28,142,245,122,4,150,128,79,0,70,23,16,46,239,29,35,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
