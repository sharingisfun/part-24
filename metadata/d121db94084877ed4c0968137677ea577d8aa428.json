They have now been adapted to comic format, executed by means of the technical expertise of designers HernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n Campos, AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s Gimeno, and Alberto Tavira; They have been published by Studiocomix under the supervision of Alfonso EspinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s and his creative team.\nThe first thing that must be said about 6 F.O.D is that, given the experimental nature of the stories, it its difficult to explain what the reader is going to find in this comic. Some of the stories could be thought to fit into genres as diverse as thriller or romance. However, when the reader begins to delve into the subsequent stories, he/she will quickly abandon this idea. It will gradually become more difficult to classify the stories. Puzzling arguments will arise on behalf of other genres and atmospheres that are dreamlike, surreal, nightmarish so the reader will be transported to a different world where nothing is what it seems.\nThe six stories will be published independently.\n\nSynopsis Joel (Face 2/6):\nA young seminarian, heavily influenced by a complicated childhood, quit what he was forced to study. During six months wanders bars and discos until he gets a strange blind date. Throughout this particular meeting he shares experiences with those who are not who they seem to be.\n\nIlustrator: AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s Gimeno\nScript writer: Juan SepÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºlveda\nEditor: Alfonso EspinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s\nCopyright Studiocomix\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d121db94084877ed4c0968137677ea577d8aa428","amp;dn":"Six+faces+of+dice+Joel+english.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d121db94084877ed4c0968137677ea577d8aa428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,33,219,148,8,72,119,237,76,9,104,19,118,119,234,87,125,138,164,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
