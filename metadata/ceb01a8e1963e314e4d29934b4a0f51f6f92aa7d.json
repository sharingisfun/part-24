The following description is from Wikipedia:\n\n\n\nThe original band consisted of Walter Zwolinski (then billed as &quot;Wally Soul&quot;) as vocalist, Tom Wilson as bassist, Michael Magann on trumpet, Lance Wright on drums, Sonny Wingay on guitar, and Bill Robb on sax and trombone. The band was the opening act for popular Canadian and American acts that were touring Canada, such as The Guess Who. At one point, the level of band popularity was such that a recently-formed Chicago opened for Brutus at the University Of Waterloo, with Chicago's debut The Chicago Transit Authority album.[1] Their 1970 single &quot;Funky Roller Skates&quot; made it to #7 on RPM's list of Canadian Content songs receiving airplay, although the track did not cross over into the top 100.\n\nBrutus disbanded in 1971, then reformed with a revised line-up and new look in 1973. They decided to add a theatrical flair to their stage act, similar to the glam rock bands that were popular in Britain during the same time. With a mixture of heavy makeup, wild costumes, and sexual innuendo, Brutus became a popular live act, but found few friends with the local authorities or concert organizers. Brutus' live performances reached a pinnacle with a sold out performance at Toronto's Ontario Place.\n\nThe new Brutus lineup recorded two singles on GRT Records in 1975, with &quot;Ooh, Mama Mama&quot; becoming perhaps in retrospect their most remembered recording -- although it failed to chart, it was named top Canadian single in an end-of-year poll by the Montreal Star. Their debut album would follow in 1976, featuring the group's #65 chart hit &quot;Who Wants To Buy A Song&quot;, but only one further (non-charting) single would follow before they disbanded.\n\nFour notable guitarists associated with Brutus were Gino Scarpelli, later of Goddo, Paul Dean, later of Streetheart and Loverboy, Jerry Doucette, who has had a distinguished solo career, and John Bride, later of the Cameo Blues Band.\n\n\n\nBand Members:\n\n\nWalter Zwolinski (lead vocals, organ, synths)\nSandy White (bass)\nSonny Wingay (guitar)\nBill Robb (sax, trombone)\nMichael Magann (trumpet)\nLance Wright (drums; 1969Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1970; 1972Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1973)\nLen Sembaluk (drums; 1971)\nBruce Gordon (trumpet, organ, guitar, bass; replaced Magann)\nDanny Smith (drums; replaced Sembaluk 1973-1978)\nJohn Bride (guitar, banjo, ukelele)\nFrank Ludwig (keyboards; 1975)\nDennis Pinhorn (bass; 1975)\nDoni Underhill (bass; replaced Pinhorn 1975-1976)\nChris Brockway (bass; replaced Underhill 1976-1977)\nWoody West (guitars)\nLaurie Del Grande (piano, organ, synths)\nDave Breckles (drums)\nBreen LeBoeuf (bass, vocals)\nPaul Dean (guitar)\nBill Wade (drums)\nGino Scarpelli (guitar)\nJerry Doucette (guitar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRock On My Hippie Brothers and Sisters.
