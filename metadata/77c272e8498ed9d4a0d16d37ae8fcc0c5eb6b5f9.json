Starting with the bronze weapons that created the first Semitic empire, and ending with the LHC collider at CERN, Rage Against the Machine gives a detailed account of why human beings have been subject to the violence of men and their devastating weapons for the past 5000 years. This is a must see documentary if you care about the fate of humanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77c272e8498ed9d4a0d16d37ae8fcc0c5eb6b5f9","amp;dn":"Rage+Against+the+Machine+DOCUMENTARY+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77c272e8498ed9d4a0d16d37ae8fcc0c5eb6b5f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,194,114,232,73,142,217,212,160,209,109,55,174,143,204,12,94,182,181,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
