It's an affordable, accessible luxury. Yet most people are only familiar with the mass-market variety. Have you tasted the real thing?\n\nIn The Brewmaster's Table, Garrett Oliver, America's foremost authority on beer and brewmaster of the acclaimed Brooklyn Brewery, reveals why real beer is the perfect partner to any dining experience. He explains how beer is made, relays its fascinating history, and, accompanied by Denny Tillman's exquisite photographs, conducts an insider's tour through the amazing range of flavors displayed by distinct styles of beer from around the world. Most important, he shows how real beer, which is far more versatile than wine, intensifies flavors when it's appropriately paired with foods, creating brilliant matches most people have never imagined: a brightly citric Belgian wheat beer with a goat cheese salad, a sharply aromatic pale ale to complement spicy tacos, an earthy German bock beer to match a porcini risotto, even a fruity framboise to accompany a slice of chocolate truffle cake. Whether you're a beer aficionado, a passionate cook, or just someone who loves a great dinner, this book will indeed be a revelation.\n\n\nBy Garrett Oliver\nPublished by HarperCollins in 2010\nEPUB, Retail, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13ac8def8a23dd88f6a8763ce01d9402829ed18d","amp;dn":"The+Brewmaster%27s+Table+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13ac8def8a23dd88f6a8763ce01d9402829ed18d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,172,141,239,138,35,221,136,246,168,118,60,224,29,148,2,130,158,209,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
