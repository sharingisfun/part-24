He decides to find out how much private companies \n       and the government know about him by putting himself under \n       surveillance and attempting to disappear  a decision that changes \n       his life forever. Leaving his pregnant wife and young child behind, \n       he is tracked across the database state on a chilling journey that \n       forces him to contemplate the meaning of privacy  and the loss of \n       it.\n       \n       Once the bastion of freedom and civil liberties, the UK is now one \n       of the most advanced surveillance societies in the world  ranked \n       third after Russia and China. The average UK adult is now \n       registered on over 700 databases and is caught daily on one of the \n       4 million CCTV cameras located on nearly every street corner in \n       the country. Increasingly monitored, citizens are being turned \n       into suspects. But if youve got nothing to hide, surely theres \n       nothing to fear?\n       \n       When David receives a letter informing him that his daughter Ivy \n       is among 25 million residents whose details have been lost by the \n       governments Child Benefit Office, he begins a journey that will \n       see him hounded across Europe.\n       \n       David soon discovers some alarming truths about what the \n       government and private companies already know about ordinary \n       citizens. He meets people who have been caught in the crossfire of \n       the database state and have had their lives shattered.\n       \n       As his concern grows, he makes a life-changing decision. He will \n       leave his pregnant wife and child behind and put himself under \n       surveillance for thirty days. The UKs top Private Investigators \n       are hired to discover everything they can about him and his family \n        and track David down as he attempts to vanish. Is it still \n       possible to live a private, anonymous life in the UK?  Or do the \n       state and private companies already know too much about ordinary \n       people?\n       \n       Forced to contemplate the meaning of privacy  and the loss of it, \n       Davids disturbing journey leaves him with no doubt that although \n       he has nothing to hide, he certainly has something to fear...\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d690b9a4b5b396bea3a5bef8b7bf&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a25e53a85e86327e1a6ab93b5dd51495638faace","amp;dn":"Erasing.David.2009.DOCU.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a25e53a85e86327e1a6ab93b5dd51495638faace","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,94,83,168,94,134,50,126,26,106,185,59,93,213,20,149,99,143,170,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
