Now she reveals her secrets so that you can begin your journey to safe weight loss and optimal health. Start now with The Start Here Diet!\n \nTosca knows what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like to feel ashamed of your body: At her heaviest, she hid behind bulky clothes and rarely had her picture taken. Her blood sugar level was like a roller coaster, and her heart rate was far from normal. Tosca was so focused on taking care of her family that she neglected her own needs. Then she started making slight adjustments in her everyday lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€small changes that brought about big results. In this exciting book, she shares the three easy-to-follow steps that helped her get her life back on track:\n \nStep 1: Dive Inward. Identify the emotional triggers for your overeating, the self-defeating Ã¢â‚¬Å“self-talk,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the underlying reason why you really want to shed the pounds. Sharing her own internal dialogueÃ¢â‚¬â€including excerpts from the journal she kept at that timeÃ¢â‚¬â€Tosca will help you overcome these internal barriers in a completely unique, accessible way.\n \nStep 2: Uncover Your Hidden Foods. Do you have a food you think you just canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live without? Or something you eat mindlessly and often? These are your Ã¢â‚¬Å“hidden foodsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and they are sabotaging your best efforts to lose weight and keep it off.  Through ToscaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transformative process, you will once and for all identify the empty-calorie foods that have added extra pounds and replace them with nutritious foods you can enjoy without weight gain. \n \nPart 3: Move a Little! The Start Here plan doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t require you to join a gym or do lengthy daily workouts. Simply choose from ToscaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s list of fifty basic movements to strengthen, tone, and improve your health. These are exercises you can fit into the rhythm of your busy life. Moving a little for even fifteen minutes a day will help reshape your body and put you on a path to weight-loss success.\n \nLike a good friend and trusted mentor, Tosca will show you how to believe in yourself again, forgive yourself, and imagine a life of joy you thought was out of reach. Her Start Here Ã¢â‚¬Å“essentialsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€shopping and cooking tips, meal plans, and thirty delicious recipesÃ¢â‚¬â€will help you learn to eat to nourish your body, not just to feed it. As Tosca says, The Start Here Diet is all about cherishing youÃ¢â‚¬â€and you are wonderful!\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nTosca Reno is an internationally known nutritionist, weight loss specialist, fitness trainer, motivational speaker, and bestselling author.
