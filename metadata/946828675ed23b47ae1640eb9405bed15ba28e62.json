This frank and fascinating autobiography tells the story of the man behind the characters, and charts the circuitous route by which he came to be a British household name. Ricky's mother used to tell him that he had lived three lives, but she underestimated the number - he has been a plasterer, banjo player, stand-up comic, union agitator, political activist, film extra, award-winning actor and unwilling guest of her majesty's prison service. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:946828675ed23b47ae1640eb9405bed15ba28e62","amp;dn":"Ricky+-+AudioBook+-+Read+by+Ricky+Tomlinson+-+128k+-+MP3+-+Slimo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"946828675ed23b47ae1640eb9405bed15ba28e62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,104,40,103,94,210,59,71,174,22,64,235,148,5,190,209,91,162,142,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
