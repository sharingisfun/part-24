This sensuous, spirited and passionate story is set against a backdrop of war, religious strife and power struggles which tears lives and families apart. In that time, there rises a magnificent Cathedral in Kingsbridge. A spellbinding epic tale of ambition, anarchy, and absolute power, set against the sprawling medieval canvas of 12th-century England, this is Ken Follett's historical masterpiece.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c2400c1e4227fd6a619025250c248fdbe2b1576","amp;dn":"The+Pillars+of+the+Earth+-+Ken+Follett++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c2400c1e4227fd6a619025250c248fdbe2b1576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,36,0,193,228,34,127,214,166,25,2,82,80,194,72,253,190,43,21,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
