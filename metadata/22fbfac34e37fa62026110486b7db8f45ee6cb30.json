As he walks off stage the film audience sees that he is actually a British man named Stanley (Colin Firth). He \n\nberates his employees and is generally curmudgeonly towards his well-wishers. In his dressing-room, he is greeted by old friend and fellow illusionist Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney). Howard enlists Stanley to go with him to the \n\nCÃƒÂ´te d'Azur where a rich American family, the Catledges, has apparently been taken in by a clairvoyant and mystic, Sophie (Emma Stone). In fact, the son of the family, Brice (Hamish Linklater), is smitten with Sophie, and his sister \n\nCaroline (Erica Leerhsen) and brother-in-law George (Jeremy Shamos) are concerned Brice is considering proposing marriage. Howard says that he has been unable to uncover the secrets behind her tricks and he admits that the \n\nmore he watched her the more he believed she really has supernatural powers. So he would like Stanley, who has debunked charlatan mystics in the past, to help him prove she is a fraud.\n\nHoward and Stanley travel to the French Riviera, but Stanley is soon astonished by Sophie's ability to go into a fugue state and apparently pull out highly personal details about him and his family. Stanley witnesses a seance in \n\nwhich Sophie communicates with the deceased patriarch of the American family. A candle floats up from the table and Howard grabs it to try to discern what trickery is at play, but is astounded to find no apparent subterfuge. Stanley \n\nbegins spending time with Sophie. He takes her to visit his aunt and they drive a convertible along the picturesque rocky corniches. When caught in a rain storm, they end up at an observatory that Stanley had visited as a child. After \n\nthe rain subsides, they open the roof up and view the stars.\n\nWhen Stanley and Sophie visit his aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins), Sophie is seemingly able, after holding aunt Vanessa's pearls, to somehow relate most of the details of Vanessa's one great love affair. This finally convinces Stanley \n\nof Sophie's authenticity and he has an emotional epiphany, feeling that his lifelong rationalism and cynicism have been misguided. He is elated at looking at the world with new eyes and even breaks off his engagement with his \n\nequally rational and dispassionate fiancee, Olivia.\n\nAt a Gatsby-esque party, Stanley and Sophie dance. As they walk together later that night, Sophie asks him if he has felt any feelings for her &quot;as a woman&quot;. Stanley, who has admired her talents as a mystic and is grateful to her for \n\nopening his eyes to a new worldview, is taken aback and admits that he has not thought of her that way. She leaves upset. The next day Stanley holds a press conference to tell the world that he, who spent his life debunking \n\ncharlatan mystics, has finally come to find one who is the real deal. The reporters drill him with questions, but the grilling is interrupted when he receives news his aunt Vanessa has been in a car accident.\n\nStanley rushes to the hospital, and in an emotional scene in a waiting room considers turning to prayer for solace. That is, if he now has come to believe in divination and mysticism, perhaps he should believe in God and prayer. He \n\nbegins to pray for a miracle to save his aunt, but is unable to go through with it. The rationality that has been his whole life comes back and he rejects prayer, the supernatural and by extension, Sophie and her powers. He decides \n\nonce more to prove she is a fraud.\n\nUsing a trick seen earlier in his stage act, Stanley appears to leave the room but stays to overhear Sophie and Howard discuss their collusion in what has been an elaborate ruse. He discovers that Sophie was able to know so much \n\nabout him and his aunt because she and Howard collaborated to fool Stanley. Sophie was indeed a charlatan tricking the rich American family and was quickly discovered by Howard. Rather than unmask her and stop the ruse, he \n\nenlisted Sophie to help him one-up his best friend and rival, Stanley.\n\nStanley is initially angry at Howard and Sophie but decides to forgive them. In a conversation with his aunt Vanessa, who by then has recovered from her car accident, Stanley comes to the self-realization that he is in love with \n\nSophie. He finds her and asks her not to marry Brice, but marry him instead. Sophie is taken aback and finds his haughty, awkward proposal unsuitable. She tells him she still plans to marry the wealthy Brice. Returning dejected to \n\nhis aunt Vanessa's, Stanley is surprised when Sophie follows him there and he proposes. They embrace and kiss as the film ends.\nCast\n\n    Colin Firth as Stanley Crawford[4]\n    Emma Stone as Sophie Baker[5]\n    Hamish Linklater as Brice[6]\n    Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs. Baker[7]\n    Jacki Weaver as Grace[7]\n    Erica Leerhsen as Caroline\n    Eileen Atkins as Aunt Vanessa[6]\n    Simon McBurney as Howard Burkan\n    Lionel Abelanski as the Doctor\n\n\nMedia Info\n\nGeneral\nUnique ID                        : 172047680002573070725373652754086495042 (0x816F2D896877AEC28E22A64257A00342)\nComplete name                    : E:Magic in the Moonlight (2014) 720p BluRay Esubs 800MB [SReeJoN]Magic in the Moonlight (2014) 720p BluRay Esubs 800MB [SReeJoN].mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 800 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 37mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 146 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2014-12-02 04:05:13\nWriting application              : mkvmerge v7.1.0 ('Good Love') 64bit built on Jul 27 2014 13:06:55\nWriting library                  : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.1\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
