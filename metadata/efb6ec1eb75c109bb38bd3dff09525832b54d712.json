It has been scanned into JPEG format, and each two-page spread is stored in a separate file. The file names have the animal names in them, and will appear alphabetically in a sorted file list. Because of the large size of this book, each page was scanned in quarters and stitched together using Autostich at Autostitch.net. Due to the oversize scanning and stitching, some color and alignment limitations are present, but overall the pictures are good for desktop wallpaper, background images, etc. A text file with each poem\\'s text is also included.\n\nThis is a wonderful book, and I recommend you check it out!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efb6ec1eb75c109bb38bd3dff09525832b54d712","amp;dn":"Animalia+by+Graeme+Base","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efb6ec1eb75c109bb38bd3dff09525832b54d712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,182,236,30,183,92,16,155,179,139,211,223,240,149,37,131,43,84,215,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
