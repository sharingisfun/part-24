After losing the battle with Peter, Paul &amp; Mary to issue Bob Dylan's &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; as a single, the best Kapp Records could manage was to repackage subsequent issues of the In Action album as Blowin' in the Wind to capitalize on the monstrously successful song record labels continued to have In Action printed on them as the album title. It's easy to see why PP&amp;M's version was chosen; it is much more passionate than the Mitchell Trio's, which is taken at a faster pace, highlighted by a folk banjo. The album starts off with a rousing bluegrass rendition of the traditional &quot;Columbus Stockade Blues&quot; renamed &quot;Leave Me If You Want To&quot;. But after that, the atmosphere is more sedate, with side one dominated by the three-part madrigal-like &quot;Story of Alice,&quot; co-written by Broadway's Jerry Bock of Fiddler on the Roof fame and Larry Holofcener. The group's now-obligatory political commentary tune was aimed at Texan Billy Sol Estes in &quot;The Ides of Texas.&quot; Each trio member is featured on solo tunes: Mitchell on &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs,&quot; Mike Kobluk on &quot;Adios Mi Corazon&quot; and Joe Frazier on &quot;Me Voy Pa Bete.&quot; All in all, a satisfying album, but without the liveliness of their previous efforts.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab202d39597f93eb7177194ddabdb2715c13e6f","amp;dn":"The+Chad+Mitchell+Trio+-+Blowin%27+In+The+Wind+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab202d39597f93eb7177194ddabdb2715c13e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,178,2,211,149,151,249,62,183,23,113,148,221,171,219,39,21,193,62,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
