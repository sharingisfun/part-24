It was Williamson who revolutionized the way that harmonica was used in the blues, elevating the humble instrument to lead status and opening the door for a raft of followers, including Sonny Boy Williamson II, Little Walter, and Junior Wells, among many others.\nBorn in Jackson, Tennessee, Williamson taught himself the harmonica as a child, influenced by great players like Will Shade and Hammie Nixon from nearby Memphis. By the time that he had reached his teens, he was already a master of the instrument. Using the name &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; Williamson, he traveled during the depression, performing with artists like Robert Nighthawk and Sleepy John Estes.\nBy the time that Williamson arrived in Chicago in 1934, he was a seasoned performer, already stretching the boundaries of harmonica playing. His use of his hands and his imaginative fills fit well into the growing &quot;urban&quot; style of blues, increasing the level of expression the instrument could bring to a song. Williamson's call-and-response method of alternating vocals with instrumental verses has become a blues standard. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0a4ba3ab34bf2b22798caae8e4c0377ba411a19","amp;dn":"%5C%27Sonny+Boy%5C%27+Williamson+-+Sonny+Boy%5C%27s+Jump-+R%26B+Began+Here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0a4ba3ab34bf2b22798caae8e4c0377ba411a19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,164,186,58,179,75,242,178,39,152,202,174,142,76,3,119,186,65,26,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
