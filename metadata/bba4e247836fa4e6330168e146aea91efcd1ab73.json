Ripped to flac and uploaded here since only mp3 versions were available and they had been compressed (volume-wise, not filesize) further, causing clipping and distortion in some tracks.\n\n\nWill be seeding for a while until there's enough secondary seeds. Upstream is 50K/sec so speeds will be so-so right off the bat. Don't bitch, it will be continuously seeded for a while. Whining for more seeds won't make it go faster so kindly stfu.\n\n\nEDIT: Whoopsie. Forgot the tagging. For those in need of them, gracenote's auto-tagger (included by default in winamp if you're unsure) has no problems grabbing the correct tags.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bba4e247836fa4e6330168e146aea91efcd1ab73","amp;dn":"Dexter+%28TV+Series%29+Season+1+Soundtrack+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bba4e247836fa4e6330168e146aea91efcd1ab73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,164,226,71,131,111,164,230,51,1,104,225,70,174,169,30,252,209,171,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
