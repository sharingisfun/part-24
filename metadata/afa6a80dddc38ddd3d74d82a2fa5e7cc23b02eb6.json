The band also uses the not equal to sign Ã¢â€°Â . The act depends mostly on story telling through acting, through the spoken word and with interesting musical accompaniment. FAUVE has its own record label called FAUVE CORP.\n\nFAUVE is made up of five main members including four musicians (vocalist, guitar player, bass player and drummer) and a video artist that produce music and videos. Because of its collaborative nature, at times a greater number of participants, at times up to 15 members would be contributing to the acts. During their media appearances, they like to keep a certain anonymity and mystery about their origins.[1] The name of the band is inspired from the Les Nuits fauves (English title Savage Nights).\n\nThe collective became known through its online postings and found almost immediate success. On 20 May 2013, the band released its debut EP BLIZZARD containing the best of their productions thus far. It made the French Top 20 in its first week of release and two of the tracks appeared in the French Singles Chart. During the Bourges Spring Festival, it won the iNOUÃƒÂ¯S award as the discovery act of the festival called DÃƒÂ©couvertes du Printemps.\n\nThe collective's first album is called VIEUX FRÃƒË†RES - Partie 1. The album will be released in two parts. VIEUX FRÃƒË†RES - Partie 1 was released on 2 february 2014 reaching number 2 in the SNEP French charts. The second part to be called VIEUX FRÃƒË†RES - Partie 2 is due in winter of 2014-2015 without a specific date set.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afa6a80dddc38ddd3d74d82a2fa5e7cc23b02eb6","amp;dn":"Fauve+-+2+albums+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afa6a80dddc38ddd3d74d82a2fa5e7cc23b02eb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,166,168,13,221,195,141,221,61,116,216,42,47,165,231,204,35,176,46,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
