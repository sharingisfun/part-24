Seinfeld's new show &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;  on Crackle.com.\n\nThe show covers familiar territory for the former sitcom star: It's a &quot;show about nothing&quot; as Larry David describes it, which is often what Seinfeld's original self-titled show was largely about. This time around, Jerry gets the help of famous friends such as Alec Baldwin, Ricky Gervais, Larry David, Michael Richards and more to take cruises around the city in cars and sit around drinking coffee.\n\nHere it is for all of you that would like the torrent!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43d2dd4cc5ac3dfffdd7e56b5150bb945d40ab5b","amp;dn":"Comedians.In.Cars.Getting.Coffee-S01E01-720P-WEBRip-H264-SledgeS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43d2dd4cc5ac3dfffdd7e56b5150bb945d40ab5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,210,221,76,197,172,61,255,253,215,229,107,81,80,187,148,93,64,171,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
