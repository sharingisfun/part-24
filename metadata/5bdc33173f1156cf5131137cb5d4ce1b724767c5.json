Also, from what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve read, it circulates with some of the songs in lesser quality than others. That is not the case of this version. A friend of mine bought a cassette of this show from the original drummer of the Gourds the first time we saw them. I think it cost $5. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember if I copied that tape or my dub of it to make the DAT. In any case I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think anyone is going to have a problem with the quality. It is top notch. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even tell where I splice the two sides together. This sounds like one long tape. I know IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to scare a lot of people off, but I may have used noise reduction in the transfer. I know, I know, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned since then, but unfortunately the cassettes are long gone so this is all I have. I only say that to be as open and honest about the transfer. If it was used, it was with a light touch because it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound like much high end is missing. Please donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let that keep you from this download if you are a fan. There are some rare cuts here, and as I said earlier, it seems to only circulate with some songs in bad condition.&quot;\n\n\nInteresting note from a listener: &quot;This...was the ONLY recording of [The Gourds which] you could actually buy until their first CD came out in 1997.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bdc33173f1156cf5131137cb5d4ce1b724767c5","amp;dn":"The+Gourds+-+KUT+Live+Set+in+Austin+TX+1995-04-16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bdc33173f1156cf5131137cb5d4ce1b724767c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,220,51,23,63,17,86,207,81,49,19,124,181,212,206,27,114,71,103,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
