The word ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? SudarshanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢??\ntranslated from its original sanskrit Su = right, Darshan =\nvision, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢??KriyaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? means purifying action. This is thus not a\npure meditation technique, and has been defined as a state of\nrelaxation by some and a state of consciousness by others.\nThis is practiced as a brief &amp; practical self-help stressmanagement\nstrategy. Subjective reports from the participants\nindicate that it reduces anxiety &amp; depression and SK has been\nfound to be useful in the treatment of depression. Various tools\nhave been used to study the effect of relaxing techniques on\nthe mind. These include EEG, evoked potentials (BAER, P300,\nMiddle latency potentials), fMRI, SPECT. EEG has been used\nto study changes during meditation, and also long-term effect\nof regular practice of meditation for the past 2-3 decades.\nDuring Transcendental Meditation(TM)an increased\nregularity and amplitude of the alpha activity was noted. The\nresults have been contradictory as different processes produce\ndifferent changes. The changes observed have been linked to\nthe type of meditation and duration of meditation practice, as\nsubjects varied greatly in their meditation techniques,\nexpertise and their performance. The difference in technique\nmay produce a dichotomy of physiological effects. Most of\nthe physiological research on meditation has been carried out\non TM, it is not known whether other stylized practices create\nthe same physiology.\nThere are no reports at present on changes in EEG and SK.\nThe aim of the present study was to study the sequential\nchanges in EEG, during the SK.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b91faea20d12182b682a77d1e8025bb774d37918","amp;dn":"Kriya+-+EEG+during+Sudarshan+Kriya+.M+Bhatia.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b91faea20d12182b682a77d1e8025bb774d37918","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,31,174,162,13,18,24,43,104,42,119,209,232,2,91,183,116,211,121,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
