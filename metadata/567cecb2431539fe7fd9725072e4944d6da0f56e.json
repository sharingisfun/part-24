Too Digital.\\&quot; That\\'s why I turned to Classic Records\\' 200g audiophile LP. On the downside, the record has, in my opinion, more surface noise than an audiophile LP ought to have. However, this disc strikes the balance that was missing with the CD. Full bass, warm sound, no treble-y harshness. This is the way to go with this classic album.\n\nTurntable: Pioneer PL-12D\nCartridge: Audio Technica (no model listed)\nPreamp: Miida 3100\nSound Card: Radeon HD 5600","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:567cecb2431539fe7fd9725072e4944d6da0f56e","amp;dn":"David+%26+David+-+Boomtown+%28200g%2C+16+bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"567cecb2431539fe7fd9725072e4944d6da0f56e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,124,236,178,67,21,57,254,127,217,114,80,114,228,148,77,109,160,245,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
