To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.\n\nNorman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his\nprocession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down, impossible to forget.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81bf92a207f2335fa9451456defc127a556692a9","amp;dn":"Norman+Mailer+-+The+Executioner%27s+Song","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81bf92a207f2335fa9451456defc127a556692a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,191,146,162,7,242,51,95,169,69,20,86,222,252,18,122,85,102,146,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
