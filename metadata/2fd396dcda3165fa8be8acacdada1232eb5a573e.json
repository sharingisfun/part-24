Les McCann's plan was to \n\nintroduce his discovery, organist &quot;Groove Holmes&quot; on a vocal album with himself\n\n(McCann) as leader.  The last track (#8) IS a McCann vocal, but the balance is\n\na very &quot;groovy&quot; party atmosphere jam session with Ben Webster, a guitarist\n\nand a trombone player.  Groove lays down all the bass with his Hammond;\n\na &quot;3 series*&quot; tonewheel organ (with Upper Keyboard percussion*,)except\n\ntrack #8 which has traditional plucked &quot;pizz&quot; bass.  \n\n\nIt took a bit of listening to determine the spare use of a LESLIE speaker on \n\nthese tracks, a &quot;single speed model;&quot; likely a 21H.  Groove's solo on #1\n\nhas no trem or vibrato...just straight, unmodulated Hammond.  &quot;Two speed&quot;\n\nLeslies (at least the ones around in 1961, if any) are always spinning...either \n\nFAST (Tremolo) or SLOW (Celeste)  The rotor on Groove's cabinet is not turning\n\nat all during his track #1 solo, so..I'm quite sure it is a Fast/Off &quot;single\n\nspeed&quot; Leslie.  It's also possible that Groove's rig employed a second cabinet\n\nwithout any rotors and that he switched between the two to get the &quot;straight&quot;\n\nsound.\n\n\nGroove's unusual solo 5 minutes into track #4 (Deep Purple) is the sound of\n\nupper keyboard percussion without any other footages added to it.  This\n\ncreates a very thin solo voice but a great player can pull it off as more \n\nthan a novelty effect.\n\n\n\nI love these things...... my excuse for spewing that second paragraph.\n\n\nFull text included\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fd396dcda3165fa8be8acacdada1232eb5a573e","amp;dn":"LesMcCannPresents%2CGROOVE+Holmes%2C1961%2CBenWebster%2CPacificJazz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fd396dcda3165fa8be8acacdada1232eb5a573e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,211,150,220,218,49,101,250,139,232,172,172,218,218,18,50,235,90,87,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
