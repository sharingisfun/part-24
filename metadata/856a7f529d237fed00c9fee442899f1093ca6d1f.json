Unpack the included rar files.\n2. Run Arcania.Gothic.4.Patch.2.exe and install\n3. Copy the cracked content from SKIDROW directory to your\nmain installation directory and overwrite.\n4. Play the game\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nRELOADED used files from a lower protected source than the\noriginal multi 5 DVD to make sure they won the release. This\nis causing problems now when the game needs to be updated.\n\nFurthermore since RELOADED used that fishy source(probably the\nrussian SecuROM 7 protected exe, they had to use several files\nfrom that version to be able to get the game running. This\nworkaround method caused various game content to disappear\nsuch as guest logs.\n\nAlso by using that same source, means that your savegames wont\nwork with this update, as they're ment to work on the russian\nversion of this game.\n\nThis also mean that you have to re-install your game, because\nRELOADED replaced all those english files with russian ones.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:856a7f529d237fed00c9fee442899f1093ca6d1f","amp;dn":"Arcania.Gothic.4.Patch.2-SKIDROW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"856a7f529d237fed00c9fee442899f1093ca6d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,106,127,82,157,35,127,237,0,201,254,228,66,137,159,16,147,202,109,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
