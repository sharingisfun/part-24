Lo (2001).\n\nR&amp;B/pop singer Christina Milian co-penned the song for Lopez before hitting the music scene herself. There is still speculation over who actually sung the chorus for &quot;Play&quot;, with the majority of people agreeing it is indeed Milian&amp;#039;s voice, and not Lopez&amp;#039;s. This has never been officially clarified or denied. When looking through the booklet of J. Lo, Milian is mentioned as singing background vocals and not as a featured artist.\n\nThe single was another hit for Jennifer Lopez, peaking at number eighteen on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It also peaked at number two on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play.\n\nThe video, directed by Francis Lawrence, shows Lopez traveling on a futuristic, multi-level airplane. Apart from the actors, the video is entirely computer-generated and took 6 weeks in post-production to finish. It&amp;#039;s often considered to be one of his best videos.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52ec3c66ca57b4cb312066e7c901df073598cd69","amp;dn":"Jennifer+Lopez+-+Play","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52ec3c66ca57b4cb312066e7c901df073598cd69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,236,60,102,202,87,180,203,49,32,102,231,201,1,223,7,53,152,205,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
