These are bawdy songs, and are sung 'in character' (although this particular CD is in a theatrical/classical style).\n\nI'd term this CD as being of 'educational' interest, as well as being worth an occasional good laugh.  Oyster Nan is definitely a naughty lass ... :)\n\nI strongly recommend the other CDs by the City Waites, as well as those by the Baltimore Consort, both of which have released some superb recordings of the folkier side of early English music. \n\nMP3 VBR ~192K\n\n__\n\nThomas d'Urfey - Pills to Purge Melancholy (Saydisc)\n\nThe City Waites\n\n\n1.\td'Urfey - Sometimes I am a Tapster new\t\t\t\t3:15\n2.\td'Urfey - Honest Shepherd, since you're poor\t\t\t1:36\n3.\td'Urfey - Blowzabella my bouncing Doxie\t\t\t\t2:41\n4.\td'Urfey - As Oyster Nan stood by her Tub\t\t\t2:49\n5.\td'Urfey - There was a lass of Islington\t\t\t\t4:38\n6.\td'Urfey - Poor Celia once was very fair\t\t\t\t2:03\n7.\td'Urfey - Oh Fie! what mean I Foolish Maid\t\t\t2:10\n8.\td'Urfey - What Life can compare with the jolly Town Rakes\t3:20\n9.\td'Urfey - I Hate a Fop that at his Glass\t\t\t1:43\n10.\td'Urfey - Would ye have a young Virgin of fifteen Years\t\t1:41\n11.\td'Urfey - Weep all ye Nymphs, your Floods unbind\t\t2:17\n12.\td'Urfey - A Soldier and a Sailor, a Tinker and a Taylor\t\t2:35\n13.\td'Urfey - Then Jockey wou'd a Wooing away\t\t\t4:08\n14.\td'Urfey - With my Strings of small Wire lo I come\t\t2:05\n15.\td'Urfey - How vile are the Sordid Intrigues of the Town\t\t2:02\n16.\td'Urfey - Like a Ring without a Finger\t\t\t\t3:02\n17.\td'Urfey - Through the cold shady Woods\t\t\t\t3:12\n18.\td'Urfey - When for Air I take my Mare\t\t\t\t2:21\n19.\td'Urfey - Young Collin, cleaving of a Beam\t\t\t1:55\n20.\td'Urfey - One Sunday at St. James's Prayers\t\t\t2:01\n21.\td'Urfey - There was an old Woman liv'd under a Hill\t\t2:46\n22.\td'Urfey - Oh! my Panting, panting Heart\t\t\t\t3:00\n23.\td'Urfey - Now listen a while, and I will tell\t\t\t5:25\n24.\td'Urfey - Oh Mother, Roger with his Kisses\t\t\t2:24\n25.\td'Urfey - Do not rumple my Top-knot\t\t\t\t1:17\n26.\td'Urfey - Come Jug, my Honey, let's to bed\t\t\t2:16\n\nTracks: 26\nTotal time: 68:42\nYear: 1990\nhttp://www.freedb.org/freedb/classical/6910261a","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6dba95535c00b20548796d903b849d01fa18564","amp;dn":"d%5C%27Urfey+-+Pills+to+Purge+Melancholy+%28Saydisc%29+%5BMP3%5D+%5Btwistle%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6dba95535c00b20548796d903b849d01fa18564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,219,169,85,53,192,11,32,84,135,150,217,3,184,73,208,31,161,133,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
