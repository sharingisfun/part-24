And, just to make that lot even more of a lot, there are again bonuses, too, of course! As it happens, they're very similar to last month's; namely, the two full-length debuts corresponding to the two previously included previews. For Dark Horse's &quot;Ghost Fleet&quot;, the preview turned out to be just an excerpt from the debut proper. For Aspen's &quot;ZooHunters&quot;, on the other hand, the preview turned out to be all-original, so I re-added that one as well. Enjoy! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d80c78e818c6951a8b4b3fd4782ffc256a9792d","amp;dn":"November+Debuts%3A+Give+No+Thanks+for+Not+Reading+a+LOT+of+comics%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d80c78e818c6951a8b4b3fd4782ffc256a9792d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,128,199,142,129,140,105,81,168,180,179,253,71,130,255,194,86,169,121,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
