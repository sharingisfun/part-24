After serving as a backing band for outlaw country act David Allan Coe, the band signed to a recording contract with Atlantic Records, releasing their self-titled debut album that year. Throughout the 1990s, they released four more albums for Atlantic.\n\nConfederate Railroad has released six studio albums. In addition, more than twenty of their singles have entered the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. Only two changes in membership have occurred, both in the late 1990s-early 2000s: Michael Lamb was replaced by Jimmy Dormire on lead guitar, and Cody McCarver took over for Chris McDaniel, the band's original keyboardist. In addition to his work with Confederate Railroad, McCarver has released one solo album and two singles. Dormire was replaced in 2008 by Rusty Hendrix.\n\nThe band's most recent album, a compilation of cover songs entitled Cheap Thrills, was issued on the independent Shanachie label in 2007. The band will release Confederate Railroad Live: Back to the Barrooms on E1 Music label in on June 15, 2010. This will be their first Live Album of their career. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 1996\n\n\nGreatest Hits is Confederate Railroad's first compilation album.
