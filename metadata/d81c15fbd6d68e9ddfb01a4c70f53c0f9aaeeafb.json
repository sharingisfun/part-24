Upon successful completion of the various challenges,\n chartered hunts and more challenges will become available. You'll earn money for your successful adventures \nalong the way and will be able to use that money to buy a collection of hunting gear that would make any hunter\n envious. But the real stars of this game are the animals. They will engage you with more realistic and often \naggressive behavior. You might encounter a mountain lion while hunting mule deer in the canyons of Wyoming, or\n be forced into a precarious position to get a good shot at a Kodiak brown bear. In addition to your primary\n weapon, you'll also have a pistol or a knife that can be drawn and used in self defense when an animal attacks.\n Rugged mountains, canyons and ravines, dense forests and rolling hills with water boundaries all will present\n unique and challenging obstacles to test your hunting skills. Choose the Quick Hunt, where you'll pick one \nanimal, a region/season and your gear; the Action Zone, where you'll have waypoints to go through while hunting\n a variety of scripted animals; or the Career Mode (the primary game mode), where you'll find the challenges\n and charter hunts that allow you to advance to higher levels. \n\nCD-Rom Minimum System Requirements: \n3-D hardware accelerator card (DirectXÃ‚Â® 8.1 compatible 32MB Hardware) \nPentiumÃ‚Â® III 800MHz or AthlonÃ‚Â® 800MHz processor or higher \nEnglish version of MicrosoftÃ‚Â® 98/ME/2000/XP \n128MB of RAM \n4x CD-ROM drive \n700MB of uncompressed hard drive space (plus 400MB for Windows 98/ME swap file or 600MB\n for Windows 2000/XP swap file) \n100% Direct XÃ‚Â® 8.1 compatible, 16-bit sound card \n100% Windows compatible mouse and keyboard \nDirectXÃ‚Â® (included) \n\n\n\t\t\tINSTALL:\n1. unrar\n2. This RIP is a little harder, because it's not an ISO.\nYou need the application path in the registry for it to work correctly.\nStart by opening Reg_Keys.key with NOTEPAD\nHere is the 2 critical lines:\n&amp;quot;Path1&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;C:\\DOWNLO~2\\TDNGRH&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Path&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;C:\\DOWNLO~2\\TDNGRH\\Program&amp;quot;\n\nYou must change &amp;quot;Path1&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;[VALUE HERE]&amp;quot;\nTo the unzipped FOLDER\nSo, for example, if you unrared to c:\nthen the program path would be &amp;quot;C:Dangerous Hunts&amp;quot;\n\nSo, the correct way to set it up would be:\n&amp;quot;Path1&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;C:Dangerous Hunts&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Path&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;C:Dangerous Hunts\\Program&amp;quot;\n\nAfter you change the values, save Reg_Keys.key.\nThen run, and click &amp;quot;YeS&amp;quot; when it ask's you if you want to enter the data into the registry.\n\n3. Run Dangerous Hunts.inc or open bindngh.exe\n\n\t\tPLEASE NOTE:\n\t   The info in the RAR is WRONG!\n    Please use this nfo file for installation!\n\t\tENJOY\n\nThis fine release was brought to you by: Lilmeanman UNltd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d81c15fbd6d68e9ddfb01a4c70f53c0f9aaeeafb","amp;dn":"Cabelas+Dangerous+Hunts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d81c15fbd6d68e9ddfb01a4c70f53c0f9aaeeafb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,28,21,251,214,214,142,157,223,176,26,76,112,245,60,15,154,174,234,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
