The perpetrators, led by Yazeed, son of Muawiyah, claimed to follow that very same religion. \n\nIt was a day ?When Skies Wept Blood?. \n\nThe sacrifice is unrivalled from the dawn of time ? yet the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (AS) and his companions is neglected by many. \n\n&amp;#039;&amp;#039;Karbala: When Skies Wept Blood&amp;#039;&amp;#039; examines the final days of the life of Imam Hussain (AS), the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) and sets out to establish the reasons behind the tragedies that took place at Karbala in the year 61 of the Islamic Calendar. Using unique footage, and talks by leading scholars, the viewer is presented with an excellent presentation for followers of the Ahlul Bayt (AS), and as an introduction to followers of other faiths. \n\nThis feature documentary is brought to you by redtears, a new media production company for Islamic presentations. Since their humble start in September 2006, redtears aims to produce media such as this documentary, to shed light on the religion of Islam to Muslims and non-Muslims alike. \n\nTrailer :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm0vIs9xD24&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm0vIs9xD24&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f114386df04dd93673c7c83077c5793e01a19d55","amp;dn":"Karbala.When.The.Skies.Wept.Blood.2007.DVDRiP.XViD+Josefiraqi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f114386df04dd93673c7c83077c5793e01a19d55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,20,56,109,240,77,217,54,115,199,200,48,119,197,121,62,1,161,157,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
