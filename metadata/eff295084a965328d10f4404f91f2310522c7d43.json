Subjects include:\n\nPosing techniques for headshots, 3/4, and full length \nGrooming and corrective techniques \nLighting patterns \nNames and uses of lights \nPlacement of lights \nHow strobes work \nMetering techniques with strobes and incident meters \nSelecting the proper light modifier \nUmbrellas, beauty dishes, Fresnel, soft boxes, and grid spots \nLighting for the mood \n1, 2, and 3 light setups \nBalancing strobe and ambient light \nIn the DVD, I light three models with different skin types; two women and one man, in a variety of settings, from soft and beautiful, to dramatic and moody. One of the great features of this DVD is that when I photograph the model, the RAW file of the image capture is displayed, so you can freeze the frame and review all of the information immediately. At the end of each section, the lighting equipment used for that setup is shown.\n\nThere is no fluff in this DVD, just useful and relevant information. This DVD enables you to put this knowledge to practical use right away and create stronger and more effective portraits.\n\nIn the future, this page will consist of images from the DVD with descriptions, plus more lighting techniques. There will be lots of information that will help you become a better photographer. Please check back in a month or so, and this page will be greatly expanded.\n\nEnjoy the DVD!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff295084a965328d10f4404f91f2310522c7d43","amp;dn":"Portrait+lighting+techniques+with+Bobbi+Lane.2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff295084a965328d10f4404f91f2310522c7d43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,242,149,8,74,150,83,40,209,15,68,4,249,31,35,16,82,44,125,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
