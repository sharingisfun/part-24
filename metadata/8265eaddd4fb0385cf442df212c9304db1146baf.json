He normally plays with his band Love Machine but, here he is showcasing his more than singular guitar-slinging skills at a live recording at the Il Magazzinodi Gilgamesh, in Torino, Italy, on the Tenth, of March, this year.\n\nBacked by the stalwart and incomparable duo of Martin Lotti; bass and Lele Zamperini; drums. This twelve number set contains a whirlwind of ferocious Texan twanginÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ numbers and heartfelt blues that covers a range of emotions. From the bittersweet lingering and tensely spine tingling feelings of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHigh Alert,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which, right from the start beautifully stuns you with the aching and slowburninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ emotion filled guitar artistry of T.S. His rendition of Freddie KingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSee, See Baby,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a wonderful footappinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ shuffler displaying his flowing and running string work, coupled with his  unique vocals which are very reminiscent of Andy Fairweather-Low combined they make for splendid foot frivolity. The raw, rocking and absolutely stinging ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBoot HillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is T.S.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tribute to the legendary Johnny Winter, make no mistake this number takes absolutely no prisoners and will strip paint! A blistering, stomping, raucous study in good old fashioned, rocking Texas Blues. \n\nTracklist\n1 Welcome to the Game \n2 See See Baby \n3 Driving Blues \n4 Coffee Shop Girl \n5 High Alert \n6 Mellow Together \n7 When It's Cold Outside \n8 Funky Love \n9 Expresso Girl \n10 Boot Hill \n11 Drama Queen \n12 I'm Good\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8265eaddd4fb0385cf442df212c9304db1146baf","amp;dn":"Texas+Slim+-+Cookin%5C%27+With+Gas+%282011%29%28blues%29+%28mp3%40320+%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8265eaddd4fb0385cf442df212c9304db1146baf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,101,234,221,212,251,3,133,207,68,45,242,18,201,48,77,177,20,107,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
