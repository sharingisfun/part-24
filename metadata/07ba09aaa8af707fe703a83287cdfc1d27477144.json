I&amp;#039;ve dug up so classic oldies like Coldplay&amp;#039;s &quot;Yellow&quot; and Maroon 5 covering Oasis&amp;#039; &quot;Dont look back in anger&quot; plus the Stereophonics covering Prince&amp;#039;s classic &quot;nothing compares to you&quot; but more importantly Jo Whiley did a special &quot;the year so far&quot; of her Live Lounge performances on the public bank holiday on April 9th (yesterday !!). I streamed it live and then did some crude / rough editing to keep all the highlights. However it is only one file and the &quot;medley&quot; includes 12 great tracks. There is a bit of talking inbetween most of the songs and the quality is ok but not great.\nIt does however have some fantastic versions of either the artists own tracks or cover versions.\nHightlights include Corine Bailey Rae doing a great version of Justin Timberlakes &quot;Sexyback&quot;, The Fray doing a really fun version of Shakira&amp;#039;s &quot;Hips dont lie&quot; and the phonomenon that is Mika doing his instant classic &quot;Grace Kelly&quot; (the best selling cd single in the UK for 3 years)and a brilliant version of The View&amp;#039;s monster hit &quot;same Jeans&quot;.\nAlso look out for The Killers covering Dire Straits&amp;#039; (from my home town of Whitley Bay)Romeo and Juliet.\nQuality varies from OK to Good.\nPlaylist:\n\nThe Killers - Rome and Juliet (Dire Straits)\nThe Killers - Mr Brightside\nThe Darkness - Street Spirit (RAdiohead cover)\nStereophonics - Nothing compares to you (Prince / Sinead O&amp;#039;Connor)\nRazorlight - Hey Ya !
