Orlov mentions that at the funeral of the late Vice President in New York City, the visiting Russian President will be killed by Russian spy Evelyn Salt. Salt, shaken at the accusation, attempts to contact her husband Mike, a German arachnologist, fearing for his safety. Meanwhile, Orlov escapes, prompting Salt to escape causing the CIA to think she is a spy. She flees to her apartment and finds her husband missing. Salt resumes and grabs essentials as well as a venomous spider. After barely escaping a highway pursuit, Salt takes a bus to New York City. The next morning, she sneaks into the heavily guarded St. Bartholomew's Church where the Vice President's funeral is being held and shoots the Russian President. She then encounters Peabody where she surrenders but escapes the NYPD.\n\nA series of flashbacks show Salt growing up in the Soviet Union where Orlov taught her and many other children to obey him and ingratiate themselves to the American government. Then, when it came to Day X, he would command them to strike from various positions in the US. Salt meets Orlov who congratulates her on her killing. He brings her to a river barge, where he tests her allegiance by having another agent kill Mike in front of her. Salt appears to be unaffected by this, thus passing Orlov's test. He then tells her Part Two of Day X, which would involve seizing the United States' stock of nuclear weapons. Salt, who had gone to Orlov only to discover his plans, kills Orlov and everyone else on the barge. She then goes to the rendezvous set up by Orlov to meet a NATO mole.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7777438f5d82ff2e5ad65707ab8ece231da2e7f","amp;dn":"Salt+2010+Angelina+Jolie+MP4+AAC+iPad+iPod+iPhone+konejo7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7777438f5d82ff2e5ad65707ab8ece231da2e7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,119,116,56,245,216,47,242,229,173,101,112,122,184,236,226,49,218,46,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
