Time appears to have stood still there. Species of animal and plant life not seen elsewhere on Earth, except in the fossil record, inhabit the place. The lakes heave with the shapes of huge grey bulks moving under the surface. The woods are places where chittering cries move about above your head, as powerful apes move swiftly in the canopy of leaves. Then, a tree splinters nearby, and a dinosaur steps out from his hiding placeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and he's eyeing YOU.\n\nJurassic Park? Not quite. The Lost World was an inspiration for Jurassic Park; in fact, a character in J.P. has the same name as one of the chief characters in The Lost World. It also inspired King Kong. But this is the original! Four adventurers go off to find the place shown in a dead man's sketch book ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they find a war between apes and Indians, prowling dinosaurs, a sparkly treasure hidden in the blue clay ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they find the Lost World. And because of the treachery of a native guide, their means of escape is destroyed!\n\n\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be167f5a8f9a461a294b892f75c1bf4a53a67362","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+Audiobook+-+Lost+World+By+Sir+Arthur+Conan+Doyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be167f5a8f9a461a294b892f75c1bf4a53a67362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,22,127,90,143,154,70,26,41,75,137,47,117,193,191,74,83,166,115,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
