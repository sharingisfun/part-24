As a type of cinematic tone poem, it emphasizes rhythm and alteration through the visual qualities of the images and the structure of the editing. When the filmmaker moves the camera closer to the reflective surface, the images become more abstract and visually dramatic. This concentration on patterns of movement, shading and texture makes H2O so wonderful.\n\nRalph Steiner (8 February 1899 ? 13 July 1986) was an american photographer and filmmaker. His 1929 film H2O was added to the National Film Registry in December 2005.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a749e3072880c0129574ba80df4631b0bdc9226","amp;dn":"Ralph+Steiner+-+H20+%281929%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a749e3072880c0129574ba80df4631b0bdc9226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,116,158,48,114,136,12,1,41,87,75,168,13,244,99,27,11,220,146,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
