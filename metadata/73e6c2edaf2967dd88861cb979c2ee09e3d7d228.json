The author emphasizes the physical constraints and practical engineering issues related to frequency in a deregulated environment, while fostering a conceptual understanding of frequency regulation and robust control techniques. The resulting control strategies bridge the gap between advantageous robust controls and traditional power system design, and are supplemented by real-time simulations. The impacts of low inertia and damping effect on system frequency in the presence of increased distributed and renewable penetration are given particular consideration, as the bulk synchronous machines of conventional frequency control are rendered ineffective in emerging grid environments where distributed/variable units with little or no rotating mass become dominant. Frequency stability and control issues relevant to the exciting new field of microgrids are also undertaken in this new edition. As frequency control becomes increasingly significant in the design of ever-more complex power systems, this expert guide ensures engineers are prepared to deploy smart grids with optimal functionality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73e6c2edaf2967dd88861cb979c2ee09e3d7d228","amp;dn":"Robust+Power+System+Frequency+Control%2C+2nd+Edition+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73e6c2edaf2967dd88861cb979c2ee09e3d7d228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,230,194,237,175,41,103,221,136,134,28,185,121,194,238,9,227,215,210,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
