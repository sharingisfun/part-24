This is her very first effort on screen; it's not as good as The Ice House, but still very moving. The story is a bit ragged, but the atmosphere more than makes up for it.\n\nMy upload of The Ice House was ripped from tape, this is ripped from DVD using a superior programme, Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b0f82adec683656c98cfef433b786bdd500440","amp;dn":"The+Sculptress+%28Minette+Walters%2C+1996%29+BBC-TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b0f82adec683656c98cfef433b786bdd500440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,176,248,42,222,198,131,101,108,152,207,239,67,59,120,107,221,80,4,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
