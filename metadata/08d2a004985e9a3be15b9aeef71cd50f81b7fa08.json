George, a psychology professor on leave to work as an interrogator, is charged with extracting any information Khalil may know. Mean-while Omar, a graduate student in Los Angeles, is painstakingly planning a series of bombs to detonate across the United States. Khalil was to lead this mission; but his disappearance doesn't slow down the plot. George senses that Khalil is hiding important information but struggles to make him disclose much. \n\n Will George break Khalil in time to stop Omar? \n\n Can the plot succeed with its mastermind imprisoned? \n\n Each man must face his own limitations as they are tested by circumstance and their own past decisions.\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d2a004985e9a3be15b9aeef71cd50f81b7fa08","amp;dn":"Captive-a+Novel+by+Megan+Lisa+Jones%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d2a004985e9a3be15b9aeef71cd50f81b7fa08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,210,160,4,152,94,154,59,225,91,154,238,247,28,213,15,129,183,250,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
