The album's title is a play on the Dwight Yoakam album Hillbilly Deluxe.\n\nThe album features the heavy guitar/bass and twisted, often violent horror themes of White Zombie, but there are also elements unique to Rob Zombie's solo career. For example, there is more of a danceable groove to the songs, and electronic sounds/vocal overdubbing are also common. Hellbilly Deluxe has been called his best album by many of his fans, and continues to be extremely popular to this day.\n\n&quot;Call of the Zombie&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 0:30 \n&quot;Superbeast&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 3:40 \n&quot;Dragula&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 3:42 \n&quot;Living Dead Girl&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 3:21 \n&quot;Perversion 99&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 1:43 \n&quot;Demonoid Phenomenon&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 4:11 \n&quot;Spookshow Baby&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 3:38 \n&quot;How to Make a Monster&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 1:38 \n&quot;Meet the Creeper&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 3:13 \n&quot;The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 3:55 \n&quot;What Lurks on Channel X?&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 2:29 \n&quot;Return of the Phantom Stranger&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 4:31 \n&quot;The Beginning of the End&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? 1:52 \n                                               \n                                                   Unrar and enjoy!!!^_^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ce598f3e8284cec017a7d650736ae326a6dbfe9","amp;dn":"Rob+Zombie%28Hellbilly+Deluxe%29-1998%28.RAR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ce598f3e8284cec017a7d650736ae326a6dbfe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,229,152,243,232,40,76,236,1,122,125,101,7,54,174,50,106,109,191,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
