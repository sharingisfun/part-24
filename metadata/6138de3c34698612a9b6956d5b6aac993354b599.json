He says that since his capture and release, terror attacks and events in the region, such as the brief Islamist takeover of northern Mali, should serve as a wake-up call of a jihadist danger. He believes militants aim to set up a seven thousand kilometre Islamic caliphate stretching from Mauritania to Somalia. Is he scaremongering, or does he have a point?\n\n\nInterviewed Guest: Robert Fowler\nPresenter        : Zeinab Badawi\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b022cpyf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b022cpyf&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6138de3c34698612a9b6956d5b6aac993354b599","amp;dn":"BBC+HARDtalk+-+06-04-2013+-+Robert+Fowler+-+Former+UN+Special+Re","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6138de3c34698612a9b6956d5b6aac993354b599","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,56,222,60,52,105,134,18,169,182,149,109,91,106,172,153,51,84,181,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
