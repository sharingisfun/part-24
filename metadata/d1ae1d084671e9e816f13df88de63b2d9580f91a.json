Thus the many fades out and in. These were also commercial breaks for this televised special. I split the major interview segments into separate tracks for those that just want to enjoy the show. This is NOT the entire 1-hour concert, just what was televised. The real set list looks like this:\n\nBorn This Way\nJust Dance\nPoker Face\nTelephone\nAlejandro\nYoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ and I\nHair\nBad Romance\nThe Edge of Glory\nEncore: Judas\n\nHopefully, the three missing tracks will turn up soon! \n\n\nAnd, as always, TRADE FREELY AND NEVER SELL!!!\n\n\n\nDoctor Golgo\nAugust 8, 2011\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1ae1d084671e9e816f13df88de63b2d9580f91a","amp;dn":"lady_gaga_sydney_monster_hall_2011_mp3_256_art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1ae1d084671e9e816f13df88de63b2d9580f91a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,174,29,8,70,113,233,232,22,241,61,248,141,230,59,45,149,128,249,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
