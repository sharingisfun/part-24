Wilson releases Kindler&amp;#039;s former comrade Meinike and follows him to Harper, Connecticut, where he is killed before he can identify Kindler. Now Wilson&amp;#039;s only clue is Kindler&amp;#039;s fascination with antique clocks; but though Kindler seems secure in his new identity, he feels his past closing in.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b60f2f610a684a71150905be593120edb5a3cc1","amp;dn":"1946.The+Stranger+%28O+Estranho%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b60f2f610a684a71150905be593120edb5a3cc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,96,242,246,16,166,132,167,17,80,144,91,229,147,18,14,219,90,60,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
