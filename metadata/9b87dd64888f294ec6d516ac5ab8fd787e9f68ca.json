It was released on September 29, 2009, as the only single of the album by Jive Records. The song was produced by long-time collaborator Max Martin and Shellback, and recorded by Spears in July 2009 while touring Sweden. 3 is an uptempo electropop song that features a heavy bassline and synthesizers. The song's lyrics talk about threesomes, while referencing Peter, Paul &amp; Mary during the chorus as sexual slang. 3 received positive appreciation from contemporary critics, with some reviewers calling it a classic Spears song.\n\nThe song also achieved commercial success by topping the charts in the United States and Canada, as well as reaching the top ten in many countries around the world, including Australia, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In the United States, 3 debuted at number one in the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first song to debut at the top position in over three years and the only non-American Idol artist in eleven years to do so. It was also the fifteenth song in history to debut at number one. The accompanying music video was directed by Diane Martel, who described it as sexy and playful. The video features Spears and her dancers in front of different black and white backgrounds. It received positive reviews from critics, who complimented its simplicity.\n\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fab2939d92bab6ced4ca&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 3 frames\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 3mn 31s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 6 144 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 25.0 Mbps\nWidth                            : 1 920 pixels\nHeight                           : 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.119\nStream size                      : 152 MiB (92%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 67 r1169M ab85c9b\nLanguage                         : English\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nDuration                         : 3mn 31s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nVideo delay                      : 490ms\nStream size                      : 9.68 MiB (6%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\nScreens:\n[link]http://s830.photobucket.com/albums/zz221/ankur1402/Britney%20Spears%20-%203/[/link]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b87dd64888f294ec6d516ac5ab8fd787e9f68ca","amp;dn":"Britney+Spears+-+3+%5BMTV+HD%5D+1080i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b87dd64888f294ec6d516ac5ab8fd787e9f68ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,135,221,100,136,143,41,78,198,213,22,172,90,184,253,120,126,159,104,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
