The first release from the Brooklyn-based producer, a four-track 12&quot; highlighted by the giddy longing of the Amerie-sampling &quot;I'm Trying,&quot; was made with the intent to move bodies on and away from dancefloors. The combination of rich and direct rhythms with narcotizing textures hinted at a love for similarly affecting, multi-purpose records produced by the Burrell Brothers and Bobby Konders. On Between Two Selves, his first album -- also released on 100% Silk -- Bouldry-Morrison crafts a more refined batch of house tracks that exposes a wider emotional range. Many of the vocal samples are pitched down; &quot;Come Closer,&quot; &quot;Bad Blood, and &quot;Fear&quot; pack seductive, churning menace. &quot;His Kiss,&quot; buoyed by sharp breakbeat accents, is dizzying and euphoric, while &quot;Please Don't Leave&quot; is all longing ache (&quot;I don't want you to go&quot;) with rattling percussion and a buried bittersweet melody. The only track without deeply emotional content is the functional &quot;Work Me,&quot; a scuffy workout that is surprisingly physical. The album could have easily been split to make for Bouldry-Morrison's third and fourth EPs, but it succeeds as a 50-minute sequence with remarkably steady quality control.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c67059f0b4b822dbb0804d0b10531cfa48779c23","amp;dn":"Octo+Octa+-+Between+Two+Selves+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c67059f0b4b822dbb0804d0b10531cfa48779c23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,112,89,240,180,184,34,219,176,128,77,11,16,83,28,250,72,119,156,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
