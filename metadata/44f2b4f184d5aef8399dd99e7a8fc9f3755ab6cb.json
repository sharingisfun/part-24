The box features three CDs. 58\ntracks are included of these iconic American artists and groups to establish in the\nmusic scene. The music spans at least two decades (70's and 80's)\n\nFirst disc- Toto-Africa, Tina Turner- We do need another hero, Whitesnake- Here I\ngo again, Hall &amp; Oates- I can't go for thatn;, Fleetwod Mac- Everywhere and 14 more\ntracks\n\nSecond disc- Reo Speedwagon- Can't fight the feeling, Huey Lewis &amp; The News- Stuck\nwith you, Chicago- If you leave me know, Cyndi Lauper- Time after time, Mr Mister\nKyrie and 14 more tracks\n\nThird disc- Cher- If I could Turn Back time, Starship- Nothing gonna stop us now,\nRoy Orbison- I drove all night, Meat Loaf- Two out of three ain't bad, Kiss- Crazy\nCrazy nights and 15 more tracks\n\nI have listed 5 tracks of each disc. These songs stand out the most with me as\nmemorable American Anthems. I fondly remembering listening to the tracks during my\nchildhood. The calibre of artists and group speaks for themselves and you know what\nto expect. The wide choice of tracks offered is unique, as there are many tracks that\nI have not listened to and I really enjoy listening to the tracks. Full credit must be\ngiven for offering variety. The British music scene during the 70's and 80's decade was\nsaturated as some American bands and groups made in-roads in the scene. Unfortunately\nnot all artists and groups received recognition in UK. There was far too much competition.\nIt is nice to listen and appreciate the music scene of America, as it really boosted some\nquality and nostalgic tracks. The idea of releasing a follow is justified as there are so\nmany tracks I have not listned to. American Anthems offers an excellent choice of tracks\nto listen timelessly. I am impressed with the album.\n\n\n\n   1. Toto - Africa                                           [03:54]\n   2. Tina Turner - We Don't Need Another Hero [Thunderdome]  [04:13]\n   3.
