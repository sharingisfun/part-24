Known as &quot;The King of the Jukebox&quot;, he was highly popular with both black and white audiences in the later years of the swing era. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him no. 59 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Jordan was a talented singer with great comedic flair, and he fronted his own band for more than twenty years. He duetted with some of the biggest solo singing stars of his day, including Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. \n\nAlthough Jordan began his career in big-band swing jazz in the 1930s, he became famous as one of the leading practitioners, innovators and popularizers of &quot;jump blues&quot;, a swinging, up-tempo, dance-oriented hybrid of jazz, blues and boogie-woogie. Typically performed by smaller bands consisting of five or six players, jump music featured shouted, highly syncopated vocals and earthy, comedic lyrics on contemporary urban themes. It strongly emphasized the rhythm section of piano, bass and drums; after the mid-1940s, this mix was often augmented by electric guitar. Jordan's band also pioneered the use of electric organ.\n\nWith his dynamic Tympany Five bands, Jordan mapped out the main parameters of the classic R&amp;B, urban blues and early rock'n'roll genres with a series of hugely influential 78 rpm discs for the Decca label. These recordings presaged many of the styles of black popular music in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, and exerted a huge influence on many leading performers in these genres. Many of his records were produced by Milt Gabler, who went on to refine and develop the qualities of Jordan's recordings in his later production work with Bill Haley, including &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot;.\n[color=Red][b]\nTracks :[/b][/color]\n\n1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Five Guys Named Moe\n2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Choo Choo ChÃ¢â‚¬â„¢boogie\n3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mop Mop\n4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ If YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re So Smart How Come You AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Rich\n5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Barnyard Boogie\n6 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fat Sam From Birmingham\n7 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Nobody Here But Us Chickens\n8 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Saturday Night Fish Fry\n9 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Is You Is Or Is You AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t My Baby\n10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Open The Door Richard\n11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Use Of Getting Sober\n(When YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Gonna Get Drunk Again)\n12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Run Joe\n13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chartreuse\n14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tamburitza Boogie\n15 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hogwash\n16 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ School Days","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5fe648a3b26616705f91468a12c4d14a051ce95","amp;dn":"Louis+Jordan+-+Jump+jive%21+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5fe648a3b26616705f91468a12c4d14a051ce95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,254,100,138,59,38,97,103,5,249,20,104,161,44,77,20,160,81,206,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
