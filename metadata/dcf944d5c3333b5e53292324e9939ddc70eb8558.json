Recognized for his publications Tiny Giants and It Disappears, as well as his signature dream-like, luscious, and meticulous illustrations (reminiscent of Craig Thompson and Farel Dalrymple), this is Nate Powell's most direct and concrete work to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcf944d5c3333b5e53292324e9939ddc70eb8558","amp;dn":"Nate+Powell+-+Please+Release+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcf944d5c3333b5e53292324e9939ddc70eb8558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,249,68,213,195,51,59,94,83,41,35,36,233,147,157,220,112,235,133,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
