In addition to continuing reissues of the great Gypsy guitarist's recordings, modern musicians continue to pay tribute to and expand on his legacy. Among these are Seattle, Washington's Pearl Django and the Hot Club of Norway, whose record label puts out their own recordings as well as those of the Dutch Gypsy guitar prodigy, Jimmy Rosenberg. Rosenberg has recorded with the Hot Club of Norway and has also put out several solo and duet recordings, the latest of which teams him with the eclectic Norwegian accordeonist, Stian Carstensen. Rose Room is a spectacular showcase of acoustic jazz, played by two of the hottest swingers on the Continent.&quot; Gary Whitehouse http://www.greenmanreview.com/bio/gary_whitehouse.html)\n\n&quot;Jimmy Rosenberg &amp; Stian Carstensen (Rose Room) \nJimmy Rosenberg is by many considered to be &quot;the greatest guitar player on earth&quot;, and here is probably his most fantastic recording ever: pure duets with accordion virtuoso Stian Carstensen. These daredevils of the Django music today make magical music, and their &quot;dialogues&quot; sparkle and shine. It is almost unconceivable that the entire CD was recorded in only one night! This CD is in fact beyond description - a must have, probably the hottest in the entire catalogue of Hot Club Records!&quot;\n\nI rest my case..... ;-)\nJust Get It if you are into this kind of music!\nAnd don't forget to grab the CD &quot;Trio&quot; as well.\n\nFull biography at: http://www.jimmyrosenberg.nl/page4EN.html\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
