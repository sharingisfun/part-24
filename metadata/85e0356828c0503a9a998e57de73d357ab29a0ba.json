Then why is her husband being charged with her murder? The very thought is ludicrous. But Chief of Police Henry Espinoza doesn't agree, refusing to listen to arguments that Sam's neighbors, Trish Anderson, Edna Radcliff and Millie Morrow present regarding his character and the relationship he had with his wife.\n\nAngry at being dismissed so easily, the women resolve to prove Sam's innocence, not only to help their friend, but to show Henry they are not ready for a nursing home just yet. Using the experience, determination, and pigheadedness their combined ages of 193 years afford them, they rush headlong into danger and intrigue, learning something about themselves during the process. They seem to have a knack for this detective stuff!\n\nGenre: Fiction; Mystery, Crime","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85e0356828c0503a9a998e57de73d357ab29a0ba","amp;dn":"Classic+Revenge+by+Mitzi+Kelly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85e0356828c0503a9a998e57de73d357ab29a0ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,224,53,104,40,192,80,58,154,153,142,87,222,115,211,87,171,41,160,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
