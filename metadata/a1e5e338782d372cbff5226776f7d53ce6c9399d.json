The game takes place in a series of ever descending randomly generated dungeon floors, packed full of monsters to slaughter and loot to pillage. The game plays like a traditional roguelike, but with a clean UI, a slick, action orientated combat system, and a massive range of enemy types, gear and room designs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1e5e338782d372cbff5226776f7d53ce6c9399d","amp;dn":"Claustrophobia+The+Downward+Struggle+Alpha+v1.04.7z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1e5e338782d372cbff5226776f7d53ce6c9399d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,229,227,56,120,45,55,44,191,245,34,103,118,247,213,60,230,201,57,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
