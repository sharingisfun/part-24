Leaving Blues #2\n\nAaron Burton is a young Texan guitarist/mandolinist/vocalist who plays country/traditional blues with a distinctly Texan spin having the talent, like our own Ian Siegal, to sound black , traditional and authentic but at the same time highly relevant to today s blues scene. Backed by a crack band that features Pat Boyack (lead guitar), Stompin Bill Johnston (harp), Christian Dozzler (piano/accordion), Sonny Collie (bass) and Dick Cordes (drums), Burton delivers twelve fine blues that could well have been recorded back in the 40s or early 50s. The title track is a deep North Mississippi Hill Country styled blues replete with downhome harp and almost spiritual vocals accentuated by a call and response holler I ll Get Mine segues into Tampa Red territory, a loping blues fuelled by warbling harp Evil Hearted Woman has a plaintive Nighthawk feel to both the vocals and the slide, the Nighthawk influence again to the fore on Baton Rouge which predictably features fine swamp harp and honky-tonk piano. Dozzler s accordion adds immeasurably to the wistful Cajun feel of I Won t Do That No More Tampa Red meets Jimmy Rogers on the compelling I Feel So Good whilst Dozzler s accordion is again to the fore on the melancholy swamp pop of Rockabilly Girl . Add in Leaving Blues #2 where Burton sounds like a Chi-Town Willie McTell the jaunty Crescent City inspired You Got Me Hooked , with it s fine harp and the hypnotic Hill Country influenced instrumental Tried And True with its tribal drumming and you have a set that will delight all lovers of quality traditional country blues.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8ce8bf1bce1032599bb16f008c269280238f261","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Aaron+Burton+-+Rising+Sun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8ce8bf1bce1032599bb16f008c269280238f261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,206,139,241,188,225,3,37,153,187,22,240,8,194,105,40,2,56,242,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
