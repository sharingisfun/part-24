Among the musical highlights: O'Connor's knockout &quot;Make 'Em Laugh&quot;; the big &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; production number; and, best of all, that charming little title ditty in which Kelly makes movie magic on a drenched set with nothing but a few puddles, a lamppost, and an umbrella.\n\n  Starring: Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds.\n\n  Directed by: Stanley Donen.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 43min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 640 x 480","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:306b95d3ca292e20acedf649ec5281a46e980be9","amp;dn":"Singin%5C%27+in+the+Rain+%281952%29+%28Gene+Kelly%2C+Debbie+Reynolds%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"306b95d3ca292e20acedf649ec5281a46e980be9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,107,149,211,202,41,46,32,172,237,246,73,236,82,129,164,110,152,11,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
