One bad situation.\n\nThe desperate hunt for a serial killer has just gotten rougher for LAPD homicide detectives Jack Cole and Jim Campbell. They've become partners. Punches mix with punchlines and the wit hits the fan when Steven Seagal plays Cole and Keenen Ivory Wayans is Campbell in the searing thriller The Glimmer Man. Wearing Buddhist prayer beads, relying on ancient potions and living by Eastern philosophies, ex-New Yorker Cole is unlike any partner the street-savvy Campbell has ever seen. The way Campbell sees it, secretive Cole is also something else: suspect #1 in their murder investigation. \n\nActors: \nSteven Seagal\nKeenen Ivory Wayans\n=======================================================================================\nThe best video/audio players to play this movie are: \n\nFree DivX Player Windows: http://www.divx.com/divx/windows/ \nMac: http://www.divx.com/divx/mac/?cid=DP0000279 \n\nVLC (VideoLan)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/&lt;/a&gt; \n\nThe KM Player  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kmplayer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4094&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kmplayer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4094&lt;/a&gt; \n======================================================================================== \nPlease be patient &amp; continue to share after your download completes. \nThe more who share, the faster everyone can get the file. \n\nTo all who post comments below: Thank you &amp; we appreciate your feedback. \n\nEnjoy!
