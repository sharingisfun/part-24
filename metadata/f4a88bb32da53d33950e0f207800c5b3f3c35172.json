With the ability to create and share online your own levels, you are up for an infinite replay value! The game is visualized as a classic tabletop board-game with dice and tokens. You can destroy walls and auto-heal as you uncover new dungeon tiles, which widens your choice of moves.&quot;\n\nGame modes:\nAdventure Mode:\n- Begin every dungeon as a new map from a long campaign: each time, your character resets to level 1. Unexplored parts of the dungeons are hidden by a fog of war. Monsters and items are placed at random, combats based on your statistics and dice rolls. Mitigate the combatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s result with a 2d6 (one for damages and the other for effects). Favor one attribute when you level up. Unlock and collect sets of dice (common/uncommon/rare/epic), but Beware! Monsters use their own too. An awareness system makes the monsters move towards you if you are in their line of sight. Dig up the walls to flee, at the cost of some precious health...\nRogue Mode:\n- Your character doesn't reset at each new dungeon and keeps leveling up until you meet your demise. What will remain is your name in the Hall of Fame and more powerful sets of dice that you can use in your next Rogue run.\nPuzzle Mode:\n- Hardcore campaign levels with no place for luck. No fog of war: the dungeon's layout (mobs and items) is shown. Monsters are static and won't move towards you. Strategize all your moves to ensure victory.\n\nFor the changelog, view changelog.txt.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/283040/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/283040/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a88bb32da53d33950e0f207800c5b3f3c35172","amp;dn":"Paper+Dungeons+v1.161","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4a88bb32da53d33950e0f207800c5b3f3c35172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,168,139,179,45,165,61,51,149,14,15,32,120,0,197,179,243,195,81,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
