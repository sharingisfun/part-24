Through this technique, it's possible to take a small image (eg, of a sunset) and sample the background colors to create a larger gradient swatch. By selectively sampling which colors you want in the gradient, it's possible to 'remove' foreground obstructions such as buildings and trees. \nImports from JPG and BMP. Exports BMP\n\nImages before and after Gradient Thief was used to sample existing images. Notice how the clouds in the first image don't appear in the second?\n\n\n\nInstallation:\nUnzip gthief.zip\nNote:The files do not go into a destination folder in the programs start menu.You will have to create a \nfolder to put the 3 files in.to keep the clutter down.\nRun setup.exe\n\nSite: http://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/143574\n\n                                      \n                                         !!!!!
