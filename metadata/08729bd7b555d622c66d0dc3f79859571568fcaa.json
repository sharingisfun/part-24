Brought on board for this album were arranger Milton Okun, producer Bob Bollard, engineer Bob Simpson, and even photographer Peter Perri, all from Belafonte's stable. Their sole accompanist on guitar and banjo was a young musician named Jim McGuinn, who in later years, would change his name to Roger and help found the Byrds. The album was recorded before 3,000 enthusiastic students at Brooklyn College. The trio was riding high, fresh from three concert tours including one with Bob Newhart and a highly charged appearance on NBC's Bell Telephone Hour a pretty heady career start for three youngsters whose average age was just 22. Baritone Joe &quot;Speedo&quot; Frazier had replaced original member Mike Pugh; Frazier sang on the bottom, with Michael Kobluk in the middle and Chad Mitchell on top. Traditional Irish tunes were always in the Mitchell repertoire; &quot;The Whistling Gypsy,&quot; &quot;Puttin' on the Style,&quot; and &quot;Johnnie&quot; &quot;Johnny, I Hardly Knew Ye&quot; are three Irish-based tunes on this album. Also noteworthy is the Jewish folk song &quot;Dona Dona Dona,&quot; written by Sholom Secunda. The Mitchell Trio were also known for satirical, humorous songs like &quot;Super Skier&quot; sung to the tune of &quot;The Wreck of the Old '97&quot; and &quot;M.T.A.&quot; and &quot;Lizzie Borden,&quot; the latter actually cracking the Top 50 as a single during the spring of 1962.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08729bd7b555d622c66d0dc3f79859571568fcaa","amp;dn":"The+Chad+Mitchell+Trio+-+Mighty+Day+on+Campus+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08729bd7b555d622c66d0dc3f79859571568fcaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,114,155,215,181,85,214,34,198,109,13,195,247,152,89,87,21,104,252,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
