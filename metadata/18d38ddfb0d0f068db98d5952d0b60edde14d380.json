He worked odd jobs across the country \nand performed as a James Brown impersonator and, through it \nall, never gave up on his life-long dream to make it big in \nthe music industry. Spanning the exciting, painful and \nuncertain months prior to the release of his debut album, \nthe film documents one man's ultimate triumph over an \nimpossible dream 48 years in the making.\n\nBradley's two albums, No Time for Dreaming and 2013's Victim \nof Love, are on the Brooklyn-based Daptone label which helped \ninspire the sound of Amy Winehouse's Back to Black and his \nemotionally intense, fervent old-school soul singing and retro\nproduction from collaborator and co-writer Tom Brennek have \nmade him critically acclaimed and a live draw across the world.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aciHdEKT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aciHdEKT&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/adi6929n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/adi6929n&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/abepuHwS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/abepuHwS&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/abuktIFQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/abuktIFQ&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFORMAT.......................: MP4\nCODEC........................: X264\nGENRE........................: Music video / Documentary\nFILE SIZE....................: 396 MiB\nRESOLUTION...................: 720*406=16:9\nFRAME RATE...................: 25.000 fps\nLANGUAGE.....................: English\nSUBTITLES....................: NONE\nRUNTIME......................: 1h 0mn\nBit rate.....................: 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)...................: 2 channels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18d38ddfb0d0f068db98d5952d0b60edde14d380","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Charles+Bradley+-+Soul+of+America+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18d38ddfb0d0f068db98d5952d0b60edde14d380","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,211,141,223,176,208,240,104,219,152,213,149,45,11,96,237,222,20,211,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
