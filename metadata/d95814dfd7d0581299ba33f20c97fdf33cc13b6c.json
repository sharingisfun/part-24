In a professional career that lasted 60 years, he demonstrated a remarkable ability to maintain his appeal and pursue his musical goals despite often countervailing trends. He came to the fore during the swing era of the 1930s and '40s, helped to define the &quot;sing era&quot; of the '40s and '50s, and continued to attract listeners during the rock era that began in the mid-'50s. He scored his first number one hit in 1940 and was still making million-selling recordings in 1994. This popularity was a mark of his success at singing and promoting the American popular song as it was written, particularly in the 1920s, '30s, and '40s. He was able to take the work of great theater composers of that period, such as Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Richard Rodgers, and reinterpret their songs for later audiences in a way that led to their rediscovery and their permanent enshrinement as classics. On records and in live performances, on film, radio, and television, he consistently sang standards in a way that demonstrated their perennial appeal.\n\n\n\nGenre................: Vocal\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2007\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Strangers In The Night\n02.I've Got You Under My Skin\n03.New York, New York\n04.My Way\n05.Somethin' Stupid\n06.When Somebody Loves You\n07.The Way You Look Tonight\n08.More (Theme From Mondo Cane)\n09.I've Got A Crush On You\n10.Moon River\n11.Something\n12.Anytime, Anywhere\n13.The Girl From Ipanema\n14.Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars (Corcovado)\n15.All The Way\n16.The World We Knew (Over And Over)\n17.Somewhere In Your Heart\n18.Cheek To Cheek\n19.As Time Goes By\n20.Let's Face The Music And Dance\n21.Tell Her (You Love Her Each Day)\n22.You And The Night And The Music\n23.Mack The Knife\n24.Summer Wind\n25.Blue Moon\n26.Bein' Green\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.A Fine Romance\n02.I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm\n03.I Get A Kick Out Of You\n04.Night And Day\n05.Come Fly With Me (Live)\n06.Day By Day\n07.Wave\n08.Desafinado\n09.Forget Domani\n10.Softly As I Leave You\n11.Let's Fall In Love\n12.Fly Me To The Moon\n13.Lady Day\n14.I'm Gonna Live Till I Die\n15.Almost Like Being In Love\n16.We Wish You  The Merriest\n17.You'd Be So Easy To Love\n18.I Love You\n19.It's Only A Paper Moon\n20.Ol' MacDonald\n21.Not As A Stranger\n22.Don't Change Your Mind About Me\n23.Chicago\n24.Nice 'N' Easy\n25.(Love Is) The Tender Trap\n26.It's Always You\n27.Cycles\n28.Gentle On My Mind\n29.Goin' Out Of My Head\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers... \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d95814dfd7d0581299ba33f20c97fdf33cc13b6c","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+Star+Mark+Greatest+Hits+2007+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d95814dfd7d0581299ba33f20c97fdf33cc13b6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,88,20,223,215,208,88,18,153,186,51,242,12,151,253,243,60,193,59,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
