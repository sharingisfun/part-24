They have permeated world history for centuries, and several extraordinary incidents add to the mystique surrounding this exotic realm. For millennia, the peoples of Asia have believed this forbidden territory to be well guarded, accessible only to the pure of heart. Knowledge that was previously only accessible through the mystery schools is now to be found in this fascinating survey of all the main features of the legend of Shambhala. Find out how the ancient monuments of Stonehenge, Great pyramid, Spitzbergen island and others are all geometrically linked to a pyramid shaped Shambhala region in northern China/Tibet where at its capstone the White pyramid can be found. 40 pages, some pictures. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52f53eb33eea00c17c72fa6d6979eeda89f7b3e0","amp;dn":"Bushby+-+Shambhala+Valley+of+the+Immortals+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52f53eb33eea00c17c72fa6d6979eeda89f7b3e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,245,62,179,62,234,0,193,124,114,250,109,105,121,238,218,137,247,179,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
