The name of the group, the &quot;Vedan Kolod&quot;, in Old-Slav means &quot;the prophetic tree&quot;. Based on thorough research, musicians recreate authentic sound of old Pre-Christian Slav culture to great details, which include now extinct Old-Slavonic dialect of the region, genuine vocal technique and authentic musical instruments, found in archeological excavations and recreated by Valerii Naryshkin. Vedan Kolod perform not only the actual folklore songs, but also compose their own instrumental compositions and songs on old folklore texts.\n\nPlease seed guys, if you like - try to buy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca917499b5f178d4116ebc07778ca3f707d74f4b","amp;dn":"Vedan+Kolod+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca917499b5f178d4116ebc07778ca3f707d74f4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,145,116,153,181,241,120,212,17,110,188,7,119,140,163,247,7,215,79,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
