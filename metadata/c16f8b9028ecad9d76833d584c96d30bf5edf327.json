Plus, there's no way most kids would get the subtext of a majority of this book. Have you hugged your cephalopod today?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'Lio - There's a Monster in My Socks'\n\nAndrews McMeel Publishing, 2012, \n\nWritten and Illustrated by Mark Tatulli\n\nFor the first time, the creepy, crawly, awesome world of Lio in a kid-targeted book.\n\nThe world of Lio is filled with the extraordinaryÃ¢â‚¬â€monsters under the bed, wild reptile pets, robot inventions, weird scienceÃ¢â‚¬â€but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all commonplace for this most uncommon young man. Mark Tatulli renders this pantomime strip in pen-and-ink style, giving the artwork a dark, spidery feel to match the strip's dark humor. Lio explores the twisted realm of a kidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s imaginationÃ¢â‚¬â€at once bizarre, creepy, and fun. Now, in this collection edited specially for kids, Lio is available to his most dedicated fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c16f8b9028ecad9d76833d584c96d30bf5edf327","amp;dn":"Lio+-+There%27s+a+Monster+in+My+Socks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c16f8b9028ecad9d76833d584c96d30bf5edf327","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,111,139,144,40,236,173,157,118,131,61,88,76,150,211,11,245,237,243,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
