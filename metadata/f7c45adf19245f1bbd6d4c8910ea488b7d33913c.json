A vast contrast to the council estate life he left behind. Following a run-in with his old estate crew, his world is turned upside down as he gets caught up in the gangland ways his friends still pursue, and before long finds himself being blackmailed by the dealers, crooks and dropouts he used to hang around with. Adding to this is his younger brother Anton, who finds himself seduced by this attractive yet dangerous lifestyle. With no easy way out, Jerome must make some impossible decisions that will have an irreversible impact on his life and career forever.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB Rating: 2.6/10 from 114 users\nDirected by: Danny Donnelly\nStarring: Adam Deacon, Nichola Burley and David Ajala\n\nRelease Name: Payback.Season.2012.BDRiP.XViD-TASTE\nSize: 700 MB\nVideo: XViD | 640Ãƒâ€”272 | 918 kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 144 kbps\nRuntime: 91 Minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7c45adf19245f1bbd6d4c8910ea488b7d33913c","amp;dn":"Payback.Season.2012.BDRip.XviD-TASTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7c45adf19245f1bbd6d4c8910ea488b7d33913c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,196,90,223,25,36,95,27,189,109,76,137,16,234,72,139,125,51,145,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
