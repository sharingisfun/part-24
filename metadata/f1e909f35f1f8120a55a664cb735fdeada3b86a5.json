A once-thriving border town, it now resembles a failed state. Infamously known as the place where women disappear, its murder rate exceeds that of Baghdad. Last year 1,607 people were killedÃ¢â‚¬â€a number that is on pace to increase in 2009.\n\nIn Murder City, Charles BowdenÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the few journalists who has spent extended periods of time in JuÃƒÂ¡rezÃ¢â‚¬â€has written an extraordinary account of what happens when a city disintegrates. Interweaving stories of its inhabitantsÃ¢â‚¬â€a raped beauty queen, a repentant hitman, a journalist fleeing for his lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€with a broader meditation on the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s descent into anarchy, Bowden reveals how JuÃƒÂ¡rezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s culture of violence will not only worsen, but inevitably spread north.\n\nHeartbreaking, disturbing, and unforgettable, Murder City establishes Bowden as one of our leading writers working at the height of his powers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1e909f35f1f8120a55a664cb735fdeada3b86a5","amp;dn":"Charles+Bowden+-+Murder+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1e909f35f1f8120a55a664cb735fdeada3b86a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,233,9,243,95,31,129,32,165,90,102,76,183,53,253,234,218,59,134,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
