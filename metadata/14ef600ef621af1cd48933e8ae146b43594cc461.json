He was kind of a &quot;self-hired and self-paid&quot; law enforcement officer. That would be a good enough story line in itself, but there&amp;#039;s another twist! He was constantly chased by a real lawman called Inspector Teal who didn&amp;#039;t see the difference between The Saint (Simon Templar) and any other criminal! That kept Simon looking over his shoulder while he went after the loot!\n\nEnjoy and please SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14ef600ef621af1cd48933e8ae146b43594cc461","amp;dn":"The+Saint+Season+3+%5BH33t%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14ef600ef621af1cd48933e8ae146b43594cc461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,239,96,14,246,33,175,28,212,137,51,232,174,20,107,67,89,76,196,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
