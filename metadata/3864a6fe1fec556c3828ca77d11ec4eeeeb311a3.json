He turns to alcohol for relief and resigns from his job to work as a private detective. Three years later, his old partner Hei (Tony Leung), now a rising star in the police force, learns that his billionaire father-in-law has been ruthlessly murdered. Hei's wife Susan (Xu Jinglei), refusing to believe in the police's version of her father's case, enlists Bong's support to uncover the truth...\n\n\n\n\nIn a city of love and prosperity, a city of lost hope and premature death, veteran detective Hei feels it all: the hurt, the helplessness, the horror. When his father-in-law, the billionaire benefactor Kim, is gruesomely murdered in his palatial mansion, he enlists the assistance of his former partner turned private detective, Bong. \n\n\n\n700 MB (717,256 KB / 734,470,144 bytes)\nDivX Style &quot;packed bitstream&quot; AVI\nOpenDML (AVI v2.0)\nInterleave: 1 vid frame (42 ms), preload=512\nAudio frames: Split across interleaves\nVideo: 537 MB (76.77%)\nAudio: 159 MB (22.76%)\nAVI Overhead: 3.28 MB (0.47%)\nVirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nVirtualDubMod build 2540/release\nDivX503b1393p\nXviD0043\n0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\n48000Hz  448 kb/s tot , 6 chnls (3/2 .1)\n\nScreen shots and trailer  &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?p=281344#post281344&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?p=281344#post281344&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n          ** If you like a screenshot based moviequiz = Please visit **\n                  \n                ** &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=9004&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=9004&lt;/a&gt;  **\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3864a6fe1fec556c3828ca77d11ec4eeeeb311a3","amp;dn":"Confession+of+Pain+%5B2006%5D+DVDRip+XviD+AC3.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3864a6fe1fec556c3828ca77d11ec4eeeeb311a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,100,166,254,31,236,85,108,56,40,202,119,209,30,196,238,238,179,17,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
