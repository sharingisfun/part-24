Anne brings a diverse group of candidates to compete for the position. The chefs are tested on their knowledge and use of spices and then told to dash to the farmers' market to create seasonal handmade pasta. Two chefs are dismissed and the final two are handed the keys to the restaurant for the most eventful dinner services yet. After both chefs struggle to keep up with the demands of a New York kitchen, Todd makes an unexpected decision and one chef walks away with the coveted title of executive chef.\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 12-7-2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1678225235e206ee071217dd0d0bf595a431a5df","amp;dn":"Chef.Wanted.S01E04.The.Re-Launch.HDTV.x264-FOOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1678225235e206ee071217dd0d0bf595a431a5df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,120,34,82,53,226,6,238,7,18,23,221,13,11,245,149,164,49,165,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
