These metrics can be extracted      \nautomatically via command line calls, exported to         \nspreadsheets, viewed graphically, dynamically explored in \nthe GUI, or customized via the Understand Perl API. They  \ncan also be reported at the project level, for files,     \nclasses, functions or user defined architectures. Most of \nthe metrics in Understand can be categorized in the       \nfollowing groups:                                         \nTree Graph                                                \n                                                          \n    *Complexity Metrics (e.g. McCabe Cyclomatic)          \n    *Volume Metrics (e.g Lines of Code)                   \n    *Object Oriented (e.g. Coupling Between Object        \nClasses)                                                  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bbe370d8bcb86ee3c556e389767f17958c77083","amp;dn":"Scientific+Toolworks+Understand+v2+6+587+Incl+Keygen+Lz0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bbe370d8bcb86ee3c556e389767f17958c77083","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,190,55,13,139,203,134,238,60,85,110,56,151,103,241,121,88,199,112,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
