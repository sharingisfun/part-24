AVRO's TopPop The Golden Years was a Dutch television program that, between 2008 and 2009, was broadcast via Netherlands 3 NPS. TopPop Golden Years brings back unique archival material from legendary TopPop broadcasts. \n\nThe series consisted of thirty minute episodes with clips from the original TopPop television program from the 70s and 80s. The broadcasts were built around themes from disco to funk, from glasses and mustaches to eroticism and from reggae to rock.\n\nThe original TopPop presenter Ad Visser has a very brief cameo beside the clip window. The clips have a few temporary trivia text bars at the bottom of the screen in dutch. There is also a small white &quot;n p s&quot; text to the top left, and a small green box to the top right, both outside of the clip window. \n\n&quot;Sunday Girl&quot; was a UK number-one single by Blondie for three weeks in May 1979. It was Blondie's second UK number-one single after &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;; it was, however, never released as a single in the US.\n\nThe song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album Parallel Lines in the UK and most other parts of the world. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Girl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Girl&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6790kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Media Length: 00:02:52\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
