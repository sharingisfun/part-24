Go figure.  Maybe it's because of the picture of William E. Gates on the front of the CD.\n\n-ekb-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ef5f6abaaec6fec32b60cf808b40bc7afbdf910","amp;dn":"Mad+Bytes+It%21+1996+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ef5f6abaaec6fec32b60cf808b40bc7afbdf910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,245,246,171,170,236,111,236,50,182,12,248,8,180,11,199,175,189,249,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
