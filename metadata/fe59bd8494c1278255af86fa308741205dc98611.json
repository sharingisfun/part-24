Clubroot will have to carry the 'Burial epigone' until the end of his days (the nastiest will call him an imitator), but there were quite a few songs on ÃƒÂ´ClubrootÃƒÂ¶ (2009) and the orbital ÃƒÂ´II - MMXÃƒÂ¶ on which the student achieved his master's level and looked him straight in the eye, fearless. There's a few of those moments on ÃƒÂ´III - MMXIIÃƒÂ¶, too, a record that should be closing a creative circle, and an opportunity to step back and think about which direction to take. It should be closing a circle, because, even though Daniel Richmond maintains the level of his previous two efforts, the formula is starting to show some wear, his movements are becoming somewhat predictable. While the first album created reasonable doubt (it was a perfect copy, but a copy it was), and the second took away that same doubt (before Burial renovated his stylistic resources with the prog twists on ÃƒÂ´LonerÃƒÂ¶, Clubroot had already used elements of trance on pieces like ÃƒÂ´OrbitingÃƒÂ¶ and ÃƒÂ´Cherubs CryÃƒÂ¶), on his third LP, he returns to introspection and expansion, at the considerable risk of collapsing inwards without the possibility to recover.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
