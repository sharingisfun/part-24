As well as singing gospel music in church, he developed a love of jazz, and learned to play the saxophone and trumpet. After forming a singing group, The Echoes of Joy, later known as The Sultans, in his teens, he studied at the University of Omaha Conservatory of Music before joining the Mississippi Piney Woods Singers, with whom he toured in California. There, he began singing in jazz clubs, achieving note with the Les McCann Trio, and came to the attention of Sy Waronker of Liberty Records.\n\nAfter recording two unsuccessful singles and an album, he was teamed with producer Snuff Garrett, with whom he recorded his first hit, &quot;A Hundred Pounds of Clay&quot;, which reached no. 3 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early 1961 and sold over one million copies, earning gold disc status.[1] Its follow-up, &quot;A Tear&quot;, was less successful but his third single with Garrett, &quot;Tower of Strength,&quot; co-written by Burt Bacharach, reached number 5 and won McDaniels his second gold record.[2] &quot;Tower of Strength&quot; reached number 49 in the UK Singles Chart, losing out to Frankie Vaughan's chart-topping version.\n\nIn 1962 he appeared performing in the movie It's Trad, Dad!, directed by Richard Lester. He continued to have minor hit records, including &quot;Chip Chip&quot;, &quot;Point Of No Return&quot; and &quot;Spanish Lace&quot;, each in 1962, but his suave style of singing gradually became less fashionable. In 1965 he moved to Columbia Records, with little success, and in 1968, after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, he left the US to live in Denmark and Sweden, where he concentrated on songwriting. He returned to the US in 1971, and recorded thereafter as Eugene McDaniels.\n\nAfter the late 1960s, McDaniels turned his attention to a more black consciousness form, and his best-known song in this genre was &quot;Compared to What,&quot; a jazz-soul protest song made famous (and into a hit) by Les McCann and Eddie Harris on their album Swiss Movement, and also covered by Roberta Flack, Ray Charles, Della Reese, John Legend, The Roots, Sweetwater and others.[3] McDaniels also attained the top spot on the chart as a songwriter. In 1974, Roberta Flack reached number 1 with McDaniels' &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot; (not to be confused with the Bad Company song of the same name), which won a Grammy Award. McDaniels also received a BMI award for outstanding radio airplay; at the time of the award, the song had already had over five million plays.\nIn the early 1970s, McDaniels recorded on the Atlantic label, which released the McDaniels albums, Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse and Outlaw.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1572954e45695de3b70fa9ee80187d5aea6b6a62","amp;dn":"Eugene+McDaniels+-+Outlaw+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1572954e45695de3b70fa9ee80187d5aea6b6a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,114,149,78,69,105,93,227,183,15,169,238,128,24,125,90,234,107,106,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
