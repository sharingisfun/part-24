They all start out very promising, allowing you to gain levels very fast, and then it just tapers off and becomes a long process of steep leveling curves. WoW itself doesn&amp;#039;t participate in the steep curves to level. \n\nBy the steep leveling curves I mean the amount of XP required to reach the next level and how it exponentially jumps up a lot to reach the next level. It generally starts off allowing you to level very fast and then at a certain level the XP jumps up at a faster and faster rate until you&amp;#039;re grinding for a week or more just for one level.\n\nThis is where WoW takes the cake. Not only is the leveling curve extremely minimal by jumping up at nearly a small set amount of XP per level, but there are nearly endless quests for you to do from when you first start a character to when you hit 70. This in turn allows you to level faster than you could have in previous games and to have a lot more fun while you do it. That is something that no other MMO had to offer and it is what they&amp;#039;re all trying to copy now, but with little success. The large amount of quests in World of Warcraft are also what make it possible to have such a revealing leveling guide unlike any other.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuesting Is What Makes Such A Revealing Guide Possible\n\nIf you chose Option B above then you already know WoW is a lot more fun and easier than other MMO&amp;#039;s mainly due to questing.\n\nIf you chose Option A above then you&amp;#039;re just so used to grinding from other MMO&amp;#039;s that had little or no quests for XP gain that you think it is how WoW should be played.\nQuesting Not Grinding\n\nThe truth is that World of Warcraft is meant to be played by having fun questing all over the world and not grinding in remote locations everything you see for hours. Sure you could grind all day but you take all the fun, and the storyline, out of the game.\n\nBefore The Burning Crusade Expansion was released, I have speed leveled many characters by questing. I also tested out how fast you could grind. There was a shocking difference in the times, faction gain, friends made, and the overall boredom. There was nearly a 4 day difference of the actual time spent in game. If that doesn&amp;#039;t already sound bad enough, since The Burning Crusade Expansion was released, Blizzard severely upped the XP rates for 2 reasons.\n\nThe first reason was simply logical, they wanted to make the content last a while since you had 10 more levels instead of 60.\n\nThe second reason was to stop people from grinding and actually enjoy the games content. The target ranged from the average MMO consumer who is used to grinding on a daily basis, as mentioned above, to the leveling services that are frowned upon and is a bannable offense.\n\nThis not only makes grinding extremely time consuming, but will never allow you to level in an efficient manner. The only possible thing you could gain from it is a lot of gold, but it makes a lot more sense to hit 70 first before you farm gold. Particularly for the fact you get more gold from higher level monsters and so that you can farm anything you want and at a lot faster pace.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI Am Now Revealing My Secret Step By Step Leveling Guide\n\nI have followed this path in my head since my first alliance character in WoW and I finally wrote it down on paper in an extremely easy to read, Step By Step guide that anyone can use. You can now get the results that you want and have fun while you do it, with less work than ever before.\n\nYou no longer need to deal with the frustration of not knowing what to do next, where you should be questing, or doing things like far away quests to only find out 5 minutes later that you found another quest that you could have done at the same time. This outstanding guide will show you what should be done next, exactly where you should be for your level, and will keep you from doing quests that are too tough for your level.\n\nEvery step is numbered and sorted by each zone that you will quest in from level 1-70. Nearly every quest in the game is covered from the start to the end and is linked to the widely popular World of Warcraft database, Thottbot. You will be able to easily follow each step to achieve your maximum efficiency of the time spent playing and your level.\n\nWhat I did with my years of speed leveling was chart down the fastest way to complete multiple quests in one running. In most cases you will able to do big loops around a zone and knock quests off left and right so that by the time you got back to town to turn them in, you had a nice experience boost. This was especially great if you just leveled out in the field and had 5 or 6 quests to still turn in and are now 30% or more into the next level. \n\nThe Best part about this guide is that you can solo all the way to 70. You may need to group a few times throughout, but you&amp;#039;ll never be dependant on needing a group again. Needing a group is also the most common mistake that people make and is the reason they resort to grinding. Most people try to complete every quest in a zone before they move on when what you should be doing is all the easier quests and come back later when you level up for the final quests.\n\nPictures Are Included\n\nI took pictures of nearly everything you have to interact with in one way or another. Pictures of what you need to pick up, odd quest turn ins, special techniques, etc. I have pictures under the step it corresponds to so that you will fully understand what you&amp;#039;re doing, and what to look for.\nUse Any Race Or Class, They&amp;#039;re All Here: Draenei, Night Elf, Human, Dwarf, and Gnome, or Shamans, Rogues, Druids, Hunters, Mages, Paladins, Priests, Warriors, and Warlocks\n\nI wrote down all the steps as well for the starting zones for all 5 races: Draenei, Night Elf, Human, Dwarf, and Gnome. These guides cover your starting race specific zones. After you do that every race has the same path to 70.\n\nYou can also pick any class and use the same guide without worries. So whether you&amp;#039;re a Shaman, Rogue, Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin, Priest, Warrior, or  Warlock, you can rest assured that you will benefit from all of the features in the guide the same.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlizzard Doesn&amp;#039;t Want You To Know This...\n\n... and they will never let you know this. Why you ask? Well it&amp;#039;s all about the big money. The less you know about leveling, the more you play, and the more money Blizzard gets. Every month they&amp;#039;re making roughly $120 Million in monthly subscriber fees alone. If you&amp;#039;ve seen any of their official guide books then you know that they don&amp;#039;t reveal anything you couldn&amp;#039;t find out in a week of playing around. They might list all the items in the game but it is obsolete in a month because they add patches with new content and items, as well as change stats and character builds.\n\nBlizzard&amp;#039;s official World of Warcraft Strategy Guide doesn&amp;#039;t show you how to do anything really. This guide helps you achieve getting from 1-70 faster.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.briankopp.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.briankopp.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b64f5344363bd3e50c6897cbb0390aff62e1e757","amp;dn":"Brian%5C%27s+1-70+Alliance+Leveling+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b64f5344363bd3e50c6897cbb0390aff62e1e757","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,79,83,68,54,59,211,229,12,104,151,203,176,57,10,255,98,225,231,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
