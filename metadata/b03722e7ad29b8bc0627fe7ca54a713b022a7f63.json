The problem is that if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re getting a cancellation notice, chances are that your Ã¢â‚¬Å“coverageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really coverage at all. If we let people keep these crappy Ã¢â‚¬Å“if you get cancer weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll give you $50Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ plans, then weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re essentially having them remain uninsured. Of course, with 5 million people uninsured because of Republican governors, what difference would a few thousand more make, right?\n\nBill ClintonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s healthcare plan back in the 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s involved everybody losing their existing health insurance and having it replaced with a better system. But everybody panicked as soon as they saw the part about losing their existing health insurance, so we never got to the better system. Most Americans are unhappy with the healthcare system, while being happy with the plan they have. So any healthcare reform had to promise people meaningful change while reassuring them that nothing would change.\n\nHouse Republicans have come up with a bill designed to allow people to keep the health insurance they currently have. Translation: House Republicans have come up with a bill designed to destroy Obamacare. OK, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say that the House bill is meant to undermine Obamacare while allowing people to keep their current plans... because it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t allow people to keep their current plans! The bill allows health insurance companies to continue current plans, but it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t require them to. So this bill allows people to keep their insurance if they like it... AND if the insurance company likes them!\n\nLouie Gohmert is saying that the Obamacare law gives Obama a Ã¢â‚¬Å“secret security forceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that he can use as his private army... but then Louie Gohmert sees that in every law. Louis reads that Obama has a private army when he looks at his alphabet soup. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all there if people would just look. Read the soup! Louie, the Obama administration is having trouble operating a website. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to be able to assemble a strike force of shock troops.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b03722e7ad29b8bc0627fe7ca54a713b022a7f63","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+13+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b03722e7ad29b8bc0627fe7ca54a713b022a7f63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,55,34,231,173,41,184,188,6,39,254,124,165,74,113,59,2,42,127,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
