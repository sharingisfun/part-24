Clarkson examines the history of the Victoria Cross, and follows the story of one of the 1,354 men who were awarded it - Major Robert Henry Cain. The main part of the programme was to describe how in September 1944, Major Cain won what was described as the &quot;finest Victoria Cross of the whole war&quot; (Second World War) by his commanding officer Lt Col Derek Mcnally.\n\nClarkson also reveals the history of the medal itself and how it is, and always has been, manufactured by a small London jeweller Hancocks Ltd, London, from bronze. The bronze itself is from the melted down breeches of a Chinese-made cannon captured from the Russians at Sevastopol in the Crimean War. The remaining lump of this metal is only enough to create around 80 additional VCs. It was locked away in a safe in a military storage depot in Donnington, Telford","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8ddcfd29885a0c0b661b28a5a1e2c545dfa1ccf","amp;dn":"Jeremy+Clarkson%3A+The+Victoria+Cross+For+Valour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8ddcfd29885a0c0b661b28a5a1e2c545dfa1ccf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,221,207,210,152,133,160,192,182,97,178,138,90,30,44,84,93,250,28,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
