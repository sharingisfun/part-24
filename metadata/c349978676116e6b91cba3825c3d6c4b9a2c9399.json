Green is the Colour/Carful with that Axe Eugene     13:55\n\n\nDetails: \nThis is a truly exellent recording from the 1970 us tour. \nThe sound is clean all the way though with no loss of volume and the bass is good and deep. The only thing wrong sound wise is that crowd can be heard faintly in the background although at very low volumes.\nAll in all its one of the best sounding ROIO's ever if you like to feel as though you where there at the concert. \nA nice mix of sound from the band and the audience... not really audience noise that affects the show, but you can tell it's clearly an audience recording. \nIt feels like you're in the room with Floyd when you listen with headphones. \nEvery song is played beautifully from start to finish. \nIt's clean, very spacey, and it's one of the few that I've come across from this time period that plays in it's entirety... without fade-outs or cuts in the recording. \n \n\n\n\n26 Sep. 1970, Electric Factory, Philadelphia PA \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c349978676116e6b91cba3825c3d6c4b9a2c9399","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Live+at+the+Electric+Factory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c349978676116e6b91cba3825c3d6c4b9a2c9399","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,73,151,134,118,17,110,107,145,203,163,130,92,61,108,75,154,44,147,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
