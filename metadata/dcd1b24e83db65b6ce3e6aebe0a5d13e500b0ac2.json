Featuring songs including &quot;Heat Wave&quot; (a cover), &quot;So Sad About Us&quot;, and &quot;Don't Look Away&quot;, the album has been ranked at #383 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time and was described by the magazine as &quot;absolutely perfect, poignant pop&quot;.\n\n\n The Who's second album is a less impressive outing than their debut, primarily because, at the urging of their managers, all four members penned original material (though Pete Townshend wrote more than anyone else). The pure adrenaline of My Generation also subsided somewhat as the band began to grapple with more complex melodic and lyrical themes, especially on the erratic mini-opera &quot;A Quick One While He's Away.&quot; Still, there's some great madness on Keith Moon's instrumental &quot;Cobwebs and Strange,&quot; and Townshend delivered some solid mod pop with &quot;Run Run Run&quot; and &quot;So Sad About Us.&quot; John Entwistle was also revealed to be a writer of considerable talent (and a morbid bent) on &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; and &quot;Boris the Spider&quot;.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Run Run Run\n 02 - Boris The Spider\n 03 - I Need You\n 04 - Whiskey Man\n 05 - Heat Wave\n 06 - Cobwebs And Strange\n 07 - Don't Look Away\n 08 - See My Way\n 09 - So Sad About Us\n 10 - A Quick One, While He's Away\n 11 - Batman\n 12 - Bucket T\n 13 - Barbara Ann\n 14 - Disguises\n 15 - I've Been Away\n 16 - In The City\n 17 - Man With Money\n 18 - My Generation / Land of Hope and Glory (Live)\n\nwww.AvaxHome.ws","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcd1b24e83db65b6ce3e6aebe0a5d13e500b0ac2","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+A+Quick+One+%281966%2F2014%29+%5BSTEREO%5D+Official+24%2F96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcd1b24e83db65b6ce3e6aebe0a5d13e500b0ac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,209,178,78,131,219,101,182,206,62,106,235,224,165,209,62,80,11,10,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
