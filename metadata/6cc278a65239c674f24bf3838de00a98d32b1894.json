The first CD is a nearly complete chronicle of everything the Pistols recorded. It has every track that is on Never Mind the Bollocks as well as each of the four B-sides to their original singles (I Wanna Be Me, Did You No Wrong, No Fun, Satellite). Kiss This also contains several covers from their earliest days: Don't Give Me No Lip, Child and Stepping Stone. The final two songs are a great bonus: Sid Vicious' version of My Way, a brilliant/stupid, trashing/celebration of the Sinatra/Presley classic; and Silly Thing, sung by Steve Jones after Rotten had left the band. \nThe second cd is Live in Trondheim, 21 July 1977, a pretty good recording of a decent performance with Sid on bass. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 73\nArtist: Sex Pistols\nAlbum: Kiss This - 2 cd box limited edition\nYear: 1992\nGenre: Punk\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc278a65239c674f24bf3838de00a98d32b1894","amp;dn":"Sex+Pistols+-+Kiss+This+%5B2cdLimEd-FLAC-1992%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc278a65239c674f24bf3838de00a98d32b1894","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,194,120,166,82,57,198,116,242,75,243,131,141,224,10,152,211,43,24,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
