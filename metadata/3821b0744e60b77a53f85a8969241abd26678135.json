Interest in steam specials has grown since before the final phasing out of British steam on the main line, when enthusiasts would flock to ride on specials Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sometimes little more than a few old brake vans behind a steam loco Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to enjoy a steam-hauled journey before diesel and electric took over for good. This practice continues today, as privately-owned steam locomotives are granted permission to run special services on the main line to the delight of passengers and onlookers alike.\n\nWith four preserved steam locomotives to drive, you can run rail tours along the wonderful Settle-Carlisle line whenever you wish. Settle-Carlisle Specials includes the famous A1 Tornado in British Railways Brusnwick Green, V2 Green Arrow, GWR Wootton Hall and GWR King Edward II in blue. There is also a Class 47 in maroon livery acting as a banker, typical of steam specials.\n\nPlease Note: Settle-Carlisle Specials requires the\nSettle-Carlisle Expansion Pack\n(available http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7871390/Train_Simulator_2013_-_Settle_to_Carlisle) in order to play.\n\nIncludes\nLNER A1 Tornado in British Railways Brunswick Green livery\nLNER V2 Green Arrow\nGWR King Edward II in blue livery\nGWR Wootton Hall\nClass 47 in maroon livery (banker)\n5 scenarios for the Settle-Carlisle Expansion Pack (PLEASE NOTE\nSettle-Carlisle Expansion Pack\n, available http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7871390/Train_Simulator_2013_-_Settle_to_Carlisle, is required to play these scenarios):\n\nHall of Fame, with 4979 Wootton\nThe Cumbrian Tornado, with Peppercorn A1 Tornado\nThe Blue Ribband, with Peppercorn A1 Tornado\nKing of the Hill, with King Edward II\nComing Home, with Green Arrow and Class 47 banker\nFree roams at Appleby, Dent, Carlisle and Ribblehead\n\nHow to Install:\n\nTrain Simulator 2012\nSet the selected files.
