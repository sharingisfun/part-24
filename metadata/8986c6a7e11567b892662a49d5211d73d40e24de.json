With the town having been hit hard by the economic decline of recent years, the two outsiders see the local citizens as likely to accept their companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offer, for drilling rights to their properties, as much-needed relief. What seems like an easy job for the duo becomes complicated by the objection of a respected schoolteacher (Holbrook) with support from a grassroots campaign led by another man (Krasinski) who counters Steve both personally and professionally.\n\nRelease Group: SPARKS (Scene)\nRelease Name: Promised.Land.2012.BDRip.XviD-SPARKS\nRelease Date: 12.04.13\nFilename: Promised.Land.2012.BDRip.XviD-SPARKS\nSource: Bluray\nSize: 1.3 GB\nGenre: Drama\nVideo: Avi | 640Ãƒâ€”352 | 1250 Kbps\nAudio: English | AC3 | 448 kbps\nSubs: N/A\nIMDB Rating: 6.4/10 from 4,748 users\nRT Critics: 5.8/10\nDirected By: Gus Van Sant\nStarring: Matt Damon, Frances McDormand and John Krasinski","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8986c6a7e11567b892662a49d5211d73d40e24de","amp;dn":"Promised+Land+2012+BDRip+XviD-SPARKS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8986c6a7e11567b892662a49d5211d73d40e24de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,134,198,167,225,21,103,184,146,102,42,73,213,33,29,115,212,14,36,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
