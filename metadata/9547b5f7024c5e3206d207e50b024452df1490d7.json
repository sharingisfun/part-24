The plot takes some unexpected turns but develops logically and clearly with just enough suspence to keep viewers entranced. When concluded you realize how all elements of the plot are kept within reasonable bounds and how refreshing that is. Here&amp;#039;s a film that relies on character development and an intriguing plot with an important message. No special effects, gore and bedroom scenes needed to make this a great movie. \n\nreally no other word for it. I find the whole of this movie compelling, from Sally Fields&amp;#039; naivete to Paul Newman&amp;#039;s innocent who turns the tables on his prosecutors, to the various supporting characters who all have their little niche. The best of all is Wilford Brimley, who gets to chew scenery and totally steal the scene he&amp;#039;s in. It&amp;#039;s an intelligent drama, addressing a subject as relevant today as it was in &amp;#039;81, with just enough humor to leaven the whole thing. \n\n720 X 480\n1:56:11\n160hbps\nDivX YV12\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9547b5f7024c5e3206d207e50b024452df1490d7","amp;dn":"Absence+Of+Malice+%28Paul+Newman%29+%7BAlien%7D+%5B1981%5D+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9547b5f7024c5e3206d207e50b024452df1490d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,71,181,247,2,76,94,50,6,210,7,229,11,2,68,82,223,20,144,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
