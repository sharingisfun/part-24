Movie is pretty good, worth checking out once.  Picture quality is not bad.  Thanks to the original uploader!  Some of my torrents are pretty obscure, and I will likely be the only seeder at times, so if you want it, leave the torrent active and your computer on and one morning you will wake up and it will be complete.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00077262850f7dd8b280127cddb5640e08b8d96c","amp;dn":"Brown%5C%27s+Requiem.Michael+Rooker.Selma+Blair.1998.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00077262850f7dd8b280127cddb5640e08b8d96c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,7,114,98,133,15,125,216,178,128,18,124,221,181,100,14,8,184,217,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
