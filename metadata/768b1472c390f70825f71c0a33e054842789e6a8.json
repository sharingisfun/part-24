This time we hit one of their biggest contractors for \ncyber security: Mantech International Corporation.\n\nWhat ManTech has to do with the FBI? Well, quite simple: In Summer 2010 the FBI \nhad the glorious idea to outsource their Cybersecurity to ManTech. Value of the \ncontract: 100 Million US-Dollar:\n\n  &quot;The FBI is outsourcing cybersecurity to the tune of nearly $100 million to a \n  Washington-area managed services company. The deal shows a willingness in the \n  federal government to place IT services more and more in the hands of third \n  parties as agencies don't have enough staff on hand to do the job.&quot;\n  \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/security/226700486&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/security/226700486&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd this is not the only Cybersecurity contract ManTech won; with a quick \ninternet search you will be able to find lots more. And just a few months back, \nin March 2011, ManTech received another 9 Million cybersecurity contract from \nthe FBI:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.euroinvestor.co.uk/news/story.aspx?id=11545467&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.euroinvestor.co.uk/news/story.aspx?id=11545467&lt;/a&gt; \n  \nWell done, good sirs. You failed epically. Because we pwned ManTech utterly and \nthroughly; and we did not need hundreds of millions for it. In fact, we did not \nrequire any funds at all, we did it with Lulz.\n\nSo we begin by releasing 400MB of internal data from ManTech, this gives \nsome insight on how they are wasting the tax payer's money. Most of the \ndocuments in this first batch are related to NATO who, you may recall, made some \nbold claims regarding Anonymous earlier this year:\n\n  &quot;It remains to be seen how much time Anonymous has for pursuing such paths. \n  The longer these attacks persist the more likely countermeasures will be \n  developed, implemented, the groups will be infiltrated and perpetrators \n  persecuted&quot;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=2443&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=2443&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIndeed, it remains to be seen. It also remains to be seen how much longer the \npublic will accept how completely incompetent law enforcement agencies are \nspending their citizens' money to fund even more incompetent federal \ncontractors. Incidentally, apart from the FBI, ManTech International has some other \nclients:\n\n   * Defense Intelligence Agency, \n   * National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\n   * National Reconnaissance Office \n   * National Security Agency\n   * Department of Homeland Security\n   * U.S. Navy, Air Force, Army, Marine Corps \n   * Missile Defense Agency and DARPA\n   * Department of Justice \n   * Department of State \n   * Environmental Protection Agency \n   * NASA, NATO, state and local governments\n\nGreat. It's really good to know that you guys are taking care of protecting the \nUnites States from so-called cyber threats.\n\nIt should also be noted that ManTech, along with HBGary, Palantir, Endgames and \nothers were involved in the now-dubbed Operation MetalGear to manipulate and spy \non their citizens using persona management software for social networks:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://wiki.echelon2.org/wiki/Mantech&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wiki.echelon2.org/wiki/Mantech&lt;/a&gt;\n  \nWe are providing these ManTech documents so the public can see for themselves \nhow their tax money is being spent. But don't you worry, the U.S. is a rich \ncountry and can afford to waste money, right?\n\nDear Government and Law Enforcement, we are repeating this message as we have \nthe suspicion you still do not take us seriously: We are not scared anymore and \nyour threats to arrest us are meaningless. We will continue to demonstrate how \nyou fail at about every aspect of cybersecurity while burning hundreds of \nmillions of dollars that you do not even have. \n\nThe director of the U.S. Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), Randy \nVickers, already resigned from his post, without proving an explanation. Let us \nprovide you with one: Mr. Vickers realized that he is on the losing side of \nthis war. A war that should never have been started in the first place. Not \nonly because the enemy was vastly underestimated and misjudged completely but \neven more because it is fought against innocent citizens who simply chose to \nprotest against the grievance of the government. You cannot win this war and \nthe sooner you realize this and call for peace, the sooner we can put an end to \nthis and solve the problems of this world together.\n\nDear citizens of the U.S. and the world: We are fighting in the name of all the \noppressed and betrayed people. In your name we will continue to fire upon these \nlaughable battleships until they are no more. Hold on tight while the seas are \nrough but we will prevail!\n\nAnonymous\nAntiSec\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:768b1472c390f70825f71c0a33e054842789e6a8","amp;dn":"Fuck+FBI+Friday+III%3A+ManTech","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"768b1472c390f70825f71c0a33e054842789e6a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,139,20,114,195,144,247,8,37,247,28,10,51,224,84,132,39,137,230,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
