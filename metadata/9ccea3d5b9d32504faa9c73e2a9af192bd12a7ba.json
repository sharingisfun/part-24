The story begins with minor league smuggling scams between Canada and the Caribbean that soon escalate to multi-ton shipments of grass and hash from the Caribbean and the Middle East. All goes well for a time, but as the stakes grow higher, inevitable setbacks occur. Drug-runners, police, jealous friends, and rival gangs all contribute to this extraordinary story of a young man who became involved at the highest levels of the drug trade and lived to tell about it.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ccea3d5b9d32504faa9c73e2a9af192bd12a7ba","amp;dn":"Smuggler%5C%27s+Blues+-The+Saga+of+a+Marijuana+Importer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ccea3d5b9d32504faa9c73e2a9af192bd12a7ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,206,163,213,185,211,37,4,250,169,199,62,42,154,241,146,189,18,167,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
