Following Mason Proper's 2008 album, Olly Oxen Free, Visger began a solo studio-based venture called Absofacto, self-releasing various singles and EPs over the next several years. He and Konicek later reconnected and began recording music together in a similar vein to the experimental art pop of their previous band. With the Hollow &amp; Akimbo project, the two musicians combine their shared passion for electronic experimentation, tape loops, and angular, melodic hooks. The band issued its first EP, Pseudoscience, in 2013 before signing with Michigan indie Quite Scientific, which released Hollow &amp; Akimbo's debut self-titled LP in February 2014.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5d5c13578f3b187f2143b4f6fbe1b5287f3dff4","amp;dn":"Hollow+%26amp%3B+Akimbo+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5d5c13578f3b187f2143b4f6fbe1b5287f3dff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,213,193,53,120,243,177,135,242,20,59,79,111,190,27,82,135,243,223,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
