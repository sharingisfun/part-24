Were Jamie and Adam responsible for a trombone travesty? \nDid the exploding hammers myth strike a low blow? As well as two other high-calibre \nmyths. First, a myth that has long been a bone of contention with fans. A trombonist \nwants to put a bang into the 1812 Overture so he fills his mute with firecrackers. \nWhen they go off, the force of the blast turns the trombone slide into a musical \nmissile which strikes the conductor and knocks him into the audience. But no matter \nhow much black powder Jamie packed into the trombone, the slide wouldn&amp;#039;t fly. \nFans have been demanding an encore performance ever since.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:959799e6ae68f13675f782a29633db96d676c884","amp;dn":"Mythbusters.S05E06.WS.PDTV.XviD-WPi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"959799e6ae68f13675f782a29633db96d676c884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,151,153,230,174,104,241,54,117,247,130,162,150,51,219,150,214,118,200,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
