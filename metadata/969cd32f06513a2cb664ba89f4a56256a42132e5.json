Although he consistently racks up dance hits in his native England (each under a different surname), he didn't achieve global success until the re-release of Better Living Through Chemistry in 1997. On the insistence of his friends the Chemical Brothers, Cook released the track &quot;Going out of My Head&quot; as the album's first single. Due to its popular video and instantly catchy sample from the Who classic &quot;I Can't Explain,&quot; Cook earned his first U.S. hit. Another unlikely sample used to great effect was featured in the track &quot;Michael Jackson,&quot; which used a snippet of Negativland's &quot;Negativland.&quot; &quot;The Weekend Starts Here&quot; is similar to the Beastie Boys' funk instrumentals, featuring distant organ and lazy harmonica blowing (which sounds an awful lot like the harmonica phrase at the beginning of Black Sabbath's &quot;The Wizard&quot;). Recommended to those who can't get enough of the popular technoid-sampled alternative dance style of the late '90s.
