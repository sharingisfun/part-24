After being ripped, the files were run through Pro Tools and very slightly tweaked to fix a few audio flaws. There are still occasional nasty noises mid song, but for the most part, the exceptions being where the record is extremely quiet, the sound is extremely clean.\n\nThe tracks are all presented to you in 44.1 khz 16 bit lossless FLAC files with level 0 encoding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d661351f506a471481e303a79a0cae32b7b894b","amp;dn":"FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d661351f506a471481e303a79a0cae32b7b894b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,102,19,81,245,6,164,113,72,30,48,58,121,160,202,227,43,123,137,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
