But since there seems to be a lot &quot;similarly&quot; &lt;cough&gt; named rips now I guess I should explain.\n\n I try to present the &quot;ultimate mastering&quot; of a particular LP, the &quot;mastering&quot; is not my equipment or process but the source material, it has always been about finding the best source. Now my opinion of the best source is subject to change as I experience more variations. Whether or not folks think my rip is &quot;definitive&quot; is irrelevant to me, I just try to find the best pressing and don't mind doing the extra clean up that comes with not just ripping new reissues or japanese issues. I understand the appeal of these pressings but I don't subscribe to the notion that they represent the best source 95% of the time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1198e36c0241add35084dcbce4fa97c363a63ced","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+Journey+-+Escape+-+1981%2C+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1198e36c0241add35084dcbce4fa97c363a63ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,152,227,108,2,65,173,211,80,132,220,188,228,250,151,195,99,166,60,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
