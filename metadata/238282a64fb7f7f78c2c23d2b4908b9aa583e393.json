On this No. 1 1972 album, even the singer's acquired-taste voice comes across smooth and beautiful--the smash &quot;Heart of Gold,&quot; with steel guitars and Linda Ronstadt's backup vocals, is by far Young's most commercial-sounding song. His usual dissonant touches, like the otherworldly guitar in &quot;Out on the Weekend,&quot; are less spooky in this new context. The\nlast two tracks, the deceptively gentle &quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; and the hypnotic rocker &quot;Words (Between the Lines of Age),&quot; predict &quot;Tonight's the Night,&quot; Young's haunted 1975 classic. --Steve Knopper\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Out on the weekend                                   [04:35]\n02.Harvest                                              [03:12]\n03.A man needs A maid                                   [04:06]\n04.Heart of gold                                        [03:07]\n05.Are you ready for the country                        [03:24]\n06.Old man                                              [03:25]\n07.There's A world                                      [02:59]\n08.Alabama                                              [04:02]\n09.The needle and the damage done                       [02:03]\n10.Words (between the lines of age)                     [06:40]\n____\n\n37:33 min\n 52,7 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
