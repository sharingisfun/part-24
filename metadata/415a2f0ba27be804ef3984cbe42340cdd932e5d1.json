Drug runner. Recovering addict. Wanted by the Southeastern Narcotics Bureau. But he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a crook, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the law. \nSNB Agent Bo SchollenbergerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solved his cases using his brains and not a gun, and with his partner, not alone. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s handed a tough new case involving designer drugs that turn users violent. One false move could end his life as he immerses himself into a motorcycle gang to locate the source. His fate depends on how well he can impersonate someone else. Someone named Cyrus Cooper. \nCyrus is everything Bo Schollenberger isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, including the badass enforcer for a smuggling ring. He establishes pecking order with his fists and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take shit from anybody, not even the undercover agent who comes to help his case. \nSimon Ã¢â‚¬Å“LuckyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ HarrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been the best, whichever side of the law he was on. Former trafficker turned SNB agent, he damned well ought to be undercover in this motorcycle gang, instead of hanging around the office going crazy with new policies, new people, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“inter-departmental cooperationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that sticks him in a classroom. Yet heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passed over for the SNBÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest case in decades in favor of the rookie who shares his bed. A man Lucky thought he knew.\nWhen survival depends on a web of tangled lies, lines blur, worlds collide, and a high stakes game turns friend to foe. Lucky knows the difference between Bo the agent and Cyrus the outlaw, but does Bo?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:415a2f0ba27be804ef3984cbe42340cdd932e5d1","amp;dn":"Eden+Winters+-+Diversion+3+-+Corruption.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"415a2f0ba27be804ef3984cbe42340cdd932e5d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,90,47,11,162,123,232,4,239,57,132,203,228,35,64,205,217,50,229,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
