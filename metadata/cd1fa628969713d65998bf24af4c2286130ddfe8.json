You can expect &quot;scream the lungs out&quot; sludge. On the other side of the split you get a couple of killer tunes by the Belgian MÃƒÂ¶se, a misanthropic sludge-metal outfit.&quot;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allthatisheavy.com/info.asp?item_num=ATH-4077&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allthatisheavy.com/info.asp?item_num=ATH-4077&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nI couldn't find this torrent anywhere so I purchased the album (lost my original copy) and uploaded it for the world to discover.  I've seen Hog Mountin a couple of times and love the hell outta their tracks.  I will seed this forever, but please purchase the album if you like it.  Both Hog Mountin and MÃƒÂ¶se deserve your money for their heavy ass efforts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd1fa628969713d65998bf24af4c2286130ddfe8","amp;dn":"Hog+Mountin+%2F+M%26ouml%3Bse+split+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd1fa628969713d65998bf24af4c2286130ddfe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,31,166,40,150,151,19,214,89,152,191,36,175,76,34,134,19,13,223,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
