The quality's not great - in addition, there's a little static in places during\n\nthe first track and a slight skip at the start of Township Rebellion. Despite that, this is an essential boot for historical\n\nreasons. Many of the songs are unreleased, and even those that did appear on the first album often sport alternate lyrics here.\n\n\n1. Killing in the Name (Instrumental)\n2. Take the Power Back\n3. Autologic\n4. Bullet in the Head\n5. Hit the Deck\n6. Township Rebellion\n7. Darkness of Greed\n8. Clear the Lane\n9. Clampdown (The Clash Cover)\n10. Know Your Enemy\n11. Freedom \n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHANKS FOR DOWNLOADING AND PLEASE KEEP SEEDING\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79f33e049743ca2c9cdf8455cb969611623ff4cf","amp;dn":"Rage+Against+The+Machine+-+live+at+California+State+University+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79f33e049743ca2c9cdf8455cb969611623ff4cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,243,62,4,151,67,202,44,156,223,132,85,203,150,150,17,98,63,244,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
