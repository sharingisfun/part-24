The ensemble consists of Nasheet Waits on drums, Carlo DeRosa\r\non bass, Tareq Abboushi on buzuq (a long-necked lute), Zafer Tawil on oud and\r\npercussion and Ole Mathisen on saxophone. â€œIntroduction - From the Ashesâ€ leads\r\noff the album with heavy drums as the group comes blasting out sounding vital\r\nand immediate with the strings and brash horns accompanied by emotional\r\nsinging. Strings and percussion usher in â€œThe Great Dictatorâ€ allowing an\r\nexotic underpinning for the horns to rise and punch through in a fast and\r\nintricate fashion. Strings and hand percussion swirl joyfully with the horns\r\nthat roar back in and lead the band to hard charging conclusion. There is a\r\nthick bass and drum opening on â€œEl-Sha'ab (The People)â€ allowing the horns to\r\nbuild upon the nimble music develop below them which even folds in notions of\r\nfunk, a ray of sunshine amidst a very serious set of music. â€œFlyover Iraqâ€ is\r\none of the highlights of the album with the increasingly thickening sound of\r\nbass, strings and percussion. The horns develop a riffing sound and build with\r\nElSaffarâ€™s rippling and punchy trumpet leading the way, over a beautiful and\r\ncomplex rhythm. On â€œTipping Pointâ€ the subtle strings and drums allow the horns\r\nspace to layer upon one another until they build to a powerful cry of pain and\r\nfrustration. The music develops a freer more open section allowing for\r\nalternating fast/slow dynamics to whip the group through to a powerful\r\nconclusion. The final tracks, â€œAneen (Weeping) Continuedâ€ and â€œLove Poem\r\n(Complete)â€ are ballads, which are alternately lush and mournful, leaving the\r\nalbum with a sense of unresolved sadness, much like the region of the world\r\nthat inspired it. This album is his reflection ElSaffarâ€™s view of the culture\r\nhe grew up with, one is that is being irrevocably changed and in a struggle for\r\nsurvival. It is a powerful album that demands to be heard, not only as an\r\nexcellent jazz LP, but also as a clarion call to artists of all disciplines to\r\nband together to make substantive changes to the injustices they see around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Stef \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2015/07/amir-elsaffars-two-rivers-crisis-pi-2015.html\r\n\r\nBy Karl Ackermann \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/crisis-amir-elsaffar-pi-recordings-review-by-karl-ackermann.php\r\n\r\nBy Hrayr Attarian \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/crisis-amir-elsaffar-pi-recordings-review-by-hrayr-attarian.php\r\n\r\nBy Richard B.
