With frank answers to their questions from nearly every major personality ever to work at the Disney-owned sports giant - both in front of the camera and beyond - Shales and Miller assemble a colorful and fascinating history of the largest and most powerful sports media outlet known to man, from the ground up. The book covers the humble roots of the company, the various sexual dalliances of the employers and employees (and even some allegations of harassment), the tumultuous relationship with the brand and Keith Olbermann's &quot;unique&quot; style, and much much more. Many famous sports stars make an appearance as well, either as subjects of discussion or interviewees themselves. The whole tale is told in the words of the people who lived it, with brilliant editing that makes the themes flow from one matter to another. If you've ever been interested in the background of ESPN, this is a can't miss book.\n\nPromotional info/Publisher's summary - &quot;It began, in 1979, as a mad idea of starting a cable channel to televise local sporting events throughout the state of Connecticut. Today, ESPN is arguably the most successful network in modern television history, spanning eight channels in the Unites States and around the world. But the inside story of its rise has never been fully told-until now.\n\nDrawing upon over 500 interviews with the greatest names in ESPN's history and an All-Star collection of some of the world's finest athletes, bestselling authors James Miller and Tom Shales take us behind the cameras. Now, in their own words, the men and women who made ESPN great reveal the secrets behind its success-as well as the many scandals, rivalries, off-screen battles and triumphs that have accompanied that ascent. From the unknown producers and business visionaries to the most famous faces on television, it's all here.&quot;\n\nSample from the Sports Illustrated review:\n'In one riveting section, Kornheiser accuses colleague Mike Tirico of sabotaging his on-air performance by not engaging him while both were in the booth for Monday Night Football. Kornheiser was ultimately replaced by Jon Gruden in 2009.\n&quot;Look, I know that Mike Tirico is smart and funny and as quick if not quicker than I am,&quot; Kornheiser said in the book. &quot;I admire and respect him, but it killed me that he had none of that for me. After many conversations, I came to believe that he had little respect for sportswriters and remembers all the sportswriters who wrote bad s--- about him. He loves it when sportswriters get something wrong. And I felt he put me in that group, because I'm part of them. It wasn't that I was right and he was wrong. We just couldn't agree.\n&quot;I had a lot of conversations with [MNF executive producer Jay] Rothman and [network executive John] Walsh and some even with [network executive] Norby [Williamson], and I'll admit I would get upset. I said, 'He's killing me, and it keeps happening.' They would say, 'We've talked to him, and it's going to get better,' but it never did. He was doing it deliberately; anybody with eyes could see it. He just wouldn't engage me.&quot;' - Richard Deitsch\n\n&quot;This treat for sports fans has a cast of characters that is huge and varied.&quot; (New York Times - Janet Maslin)\n\nThis torrent contains the EPUB and MOBI versions, both from different sources, and a PDF conversion from the EPUB edition.
