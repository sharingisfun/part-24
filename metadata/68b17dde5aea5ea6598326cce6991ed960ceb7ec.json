It enables systematic development of optimal vision algorithms when used with optimization principles.\n\nThis detailed and thoroughly enhanced third edition presents a comprehensive study / reference to theories, methodologies and recent developments in solving computer vision problems based on MRFs, statistics and optimisation. It treats various problems in low- and high-level computational vision in a systematic and unified way within the MAP-MRF framework. Among the main issues covered are: how to use MRFs to encode contextual constraints that are indispensable to image understanding; how to derive the objective function for the optimal solution to a problem; and how to design computational algorithms for finding an optimal solution.\n\nEasy-to-follow and coherent, the revised edition is accessible, includes the most recent advances, and has new and expanded sections on such topics as:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Discriminative Random Fields (DRF)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Strong Random Fields (SRF)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Spatial-Temporal Models\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Total Variation Models\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Learning MRF for Classification (motivation + DRF)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Relation to Graphic Models\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Graph Cuts\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Belief Propagation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68b17dde5aea5ea6598326cce6991ed960ceb7ec","amp;dn":"Markov+Random+Field+Modeling+In+Image+Analysis%2C+3rd+Edition+%28200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68b17dde5aea5ea6598326cce6991ed960ceb7ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,177,125,222,90,234,94,166,89,131,38,204,230,153,30,217,96,206,183,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
