CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Fly Without Gravity is a brilliant, heavy phrase that sits on an album that is more lifted and light, so much so that the highlight Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpaceshipÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ joyfully jettisons the lyric Ã¢â‚¬Å“People think IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m crazy for thinking so highÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ over a beat thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s polished pop. The twitchy funkster Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dance in Yo CarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds like Prince when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uptempo and poignant, and somehow, they found a way to jam strings into this wonderful rave-up. EDM fuels Ã¢â‚¬Å“WiLD4TheNight (EgoLand)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where fame and doubt rule the show, but what cripples Kid Cudi into a depression spiral only makes k-os stronger, as the hooky song warns of these temptations without succumbing to them. The manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outgoing nature protects him from such pratfalls with kinetic energy and connectable lyrics filling the songs, and while the artist may see this as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“more stripped-downÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ effort after the ambitious, two-disc Black on Blonde, this busy collection is really just more free. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Steel Sharpens SteelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ travels off into the compressed punk land of Death Grips for a less caustic version of rap-rock, while the boomy beats of TimbalandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Indian FluteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are borrowed for the short stab called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rap Zealot.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get UpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comes off like Q-Tip, a gospel choir, and a marching band with k-os as their conductor, and if an album ever slinked into a room, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this one, since the opening Ã¢â‚¬Å“SnapbackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is driven by jazz vamping at its coolest. Ã¢â‚¬Å“K-os, the fourth FugeeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ he rightfully claims on the opener, and while he could have gone with Ã¢â‚¬Å“a more connectable Kardinal Offishall,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Wyclef-ian CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Fly Without Gravity suggests heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s k-os, the rich and rewarding artist, even when on Ã¢â‚¬Å“vacation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
