He was our first true celebrity, one of the most photographed faces of the 19th and 20th centuries. This course explores Twain's dual identities as one of our classic authors and as an almost mythical presence in our nation's cultural life. It seeks to appreciate Twain's literary achievements and to understand his life by highlighting seven of his major works:\n\nInnocents Abroad\nRoughing It\nOld Times on the Mississippi\nThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn\nA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\nThe Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson.\n\nProfessor Stephen Railton is extraordinarily qualified to bring to light the subtlest insights into Twain's texts. An expert on Twain, he has appeared on The Newshour with Jim Lehrer as a distinguished Twain scholar and is the creator of Mark Twain in His Times, an award-winning Internet archive about Twain's life and career. Professor Railton shows the issues that concerned Twain most throughout his lifetime and that appear repeatedly in the pages of his books.\n\n\n01 Needing No Introduction?\n02 From Samuel Clemens to Mark Twain\n03 The Sense of Mark Twain's Humor\n04 Marketing Twain\n05 Innocents Abroad, IÃ¢â‚¬â€Going East\n06 Innocents Abroad, IIÃ¢â‚¬â€Traveling to Unlearn\n07 Roughing ItÃ¢â‚¬â€Going West\n08 The Lecture Tours\n09 The Whittier After-Dinner Speech\n10 &quot;Old Times on the Mississippi&quot;\n11 The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\n12 The Performances of Tom Sawyer\n13 Huck Finn, IÃ¢â‚¬â€Defining an American Voice\n14 Huck Finn, IIÃ¢â‚¬â€The Quest for Freedom\n15 Huck Finn, IIIÃ¢â‚¬â€The Great American Novel?\n16 Huck Finn, IVÃ¢â‚¬â€Classrooms and Controversy\n17 Connecticut Yankee, IÃ¢â‚¬â€Unwriting the Middle Ages\n18 Connecticut Yankee, IIÃ¢â‚¬â€Revisiting the Nineteenth Century\n19 Connecticut Yankee, IIIÃ¢â‚¬â€The Quest for Status\n20 Pudd'nhead WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â€Fictions of Law and Custom\n21 Anti-Imperialist Works\n22 Late Twain in Public\n23 Late Twain in Private\n24 Sam Clemens is Dead/Long Live Mark Twain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f9fbc4a13b7a5f2f1c8f48d3a7211f103a3b347","amp;dn":"TTC+Stephen+Railton+-+The+Life+and+Work+of+Mark+Twain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f9fbc4a13b7a5f2f1c8f48d3a7211f103a3b347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,159,188,74,19,183,165,242,241,200,244,141,58,114,17,241,3,163,179,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
