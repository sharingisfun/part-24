Within weeks of the diagnosis, the disease causes Simon to lose the use of his voice. Faced with the prospect of a rapid physical decline, Simon tells his family that he is considering ending his life at a Swiss suicide clinic.\r\n\r\nFilmed and directed by award-winning filmmaker Rowan Deacon, and made in partnership with the Open University, this intimate and deeply moving film follows Simon and his family and friends as they grapple with the huge moral, emotional and legal dilemmas around Simon's choice. Their conflicting perspectives unearth difficult questions for Simon which mean that his heartwrenching decision is hanging in the balance until the very end.\r\n\r\nShot against the backdrop of the recent parliamentary debate on the assisted dying bill, Simon's remarkable story explores the complex human questions at the heart of this deeply divisive issue.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 492 MiB\r\nDuration : 1h 24mn\r\nOverall bit rate : 815 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : HEVC\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nDelay relative to video : 3ms\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0332e415bbadefd1ae92d0fbf51715ed3b8b83bb","amp;dn":"BBC+How+to+Die%3A+Simon%27s+Choice+720p+x265+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0332e415bbadefd1ae92d0fbf51715ed3b8b83bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,50,228,21,187,173,239,209,174,146,208,251,245,23,21,237,59,139,131,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
