There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% &amp; the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.\n\nIf your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first\nremove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.\n\nHere's a link for how to remove the front cover...\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&lt;/a&gt;\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThose that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot &amp; how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games.
