The music is lovely, Dotrice embodies each of the rabbits with a great deal of character and individual presence, and the abridgement is very fine -- this adaption is more true to the book than the movie was (though most of the rabbit stories have been left out due to time), and includes some of the best of Adams&amp;#039; pastoral descriptions. Fans of Watership Down will not miss much here. Recorded from the vinyl and click-removed in Audacity, then converted to VBR mp3 using CDEX.
