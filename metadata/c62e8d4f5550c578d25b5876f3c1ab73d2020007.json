Titled Megatrap, the eight-track record arrived on the shelves at Berlin record store Hard Wax today. (Hard Wax are calling it an EP, not an album.) \n\nMegatrap contains an &quot;XXX Mono Mix&quot; of 2010's piano house anthem &quot;It's A Love Thing,&quot; along with seven other unreleased cuts. It's available on both vinyl and digital formats via Pawlowitz's Power House label. You can listen to soundclips over at Hard Wax.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c62e8d4f5550c578d25b5876f3c1ab73d2020007","amp;dn":"Head+High+-+Megatrap+%5B2014-320-Web%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c62e8d4f5550c578d25b5876f3c1ab73d2020007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,46,141,79,85,80,197,120,210,91,88,118,243,193,171,115,210,2,0,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
