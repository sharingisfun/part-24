It\nwas a vicious surprise attack, ending with corpses piled in the\nstreets and psychological wounds that would last a lifetime.\nSuspects were rounded up, trials were held, and a virulent\nbacklash against persons of Mexican origin erupted. General John\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Black JackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Pershing was told to assemble a small army, head\ninto Mexico, and get Villa, dead or alive. The last hurrah for\nthe U.S. cavalry, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Punitive ExpeditionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ marked AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nfirst use of armored tanks, airplanes, and trucks against an\nenemy. One of the deputies Pershing would choose was a recent\nWest Point graduate named George Patton.The expedition brought\nthe United States and Mexico to the brink of war, but it also\nrestored greatness to both prey and predator. More than a classic\naccount of the war for control of the West, The General and the\nJaguar is a brilliant chronicle of obsession and revenge and a\ndual portrait of John Pershing and Pancho Villa, two of the\ngreatest military minds of all time.\n\nThe General and the Jaguar:\nPershing's Hunt for Pancho Villa\nBy: Eileen Welsome\nISBN13: 9780803222243\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 875","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd193c6bb193b0fa7d988e2015e133a774d1f6dc","amp;dn":"%23The+General+and+the+Jaguar+Pershing%27s+Hunt+for+Pancho+Villa+by+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd193c6bb193b0fa7d988e2015e133a774d1f6dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,25,60,107,177,147,176,250,125,152,142,32,21,225,51,167,116,209,246,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
