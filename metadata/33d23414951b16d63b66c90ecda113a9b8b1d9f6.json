W Whitney (Mpls.) - See all my reviews\n(REAL NAME)     \n\nThis review is from: Something Borrowed Something Blue (Audio CD) \nEverything on Scape (Pole/Stefan Betke's label) has been good but this is definitely one of the stand out records. In a similar vein as the earlier Pole material with the whole dub foundation, but different enough to constitute it's own thing. In my opinion this is what a lot of people are trying to do with the integration of the organic/electronic sound, but this just nails it. Buy it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Deadbeat-Something-Borrowed-Something-Blue/release/240315&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Deadbeat-Something-Borrowed-Something-Blue/release/240315&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33d23414951b16d63b66c90ecda113a9b8b1d9f6","amp;dn":"Deadbeat+-+Something+Borrowed%2C+Something+Blue+%282004%29+FLAC+%26+%5B320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33d23414951b16d63b66c90ecda113a9b8b1d9f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,210,52,20,149,27,22,214,59,102,201,14,205,161,19,169,184,177,217,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
