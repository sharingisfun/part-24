Like the matrix numbers suggest, it was a half-speed master too. The sound quality is very good indeed with a lot of power and not too much compression by the HD Protools mastering. I'm going to guess it was mastered at 96/24 but there's not mmuch of a way to tell. Not much more to add apart from it was fun to work on, I enjoyed every minute of it and I'm not even a huge Queen fan. Enjoy!\n\n Euripides May 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b6770e48fa4b6e598b901f5cd9ff57226911d5","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+Queen+-+Queen+On+Fire.+Live+At+The+Bowl+-+2004%2C+Vinyl+Ri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b6770e48fa4b6e598b901f5cd9ff57226911d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,182,119,14,72,250,75,110,89,139,144,31,92,217,255,87,34,105,17,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
