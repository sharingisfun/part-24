I first saw them in 1983 at the On Broadway in San Francisco. My brother Lars Frederiksen was at that same show but I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know him at the time. We recently toured with G.B.H.Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I always enjoy watching them play and thirty years later they still kill it. This song was originally on their Leather, Bristles, Studs &amp; Acne EP, which came out in 1981. I always dug how this song started out bluesy, then turned into full-on hardcore.\nWritten by G.B.H.\nTim Timebomb-Vocals, Guitar\nKevin Bivona-Guitar\nJustin Bivona-Bass\nJesse Bivona-Drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:414d614a9c1196c62086001dd378aee3aa5c84e7","amp;dn":"Alcohol+-+Tim+Timebomb+%26amp%3B+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"414d614a9c1196c62086001dd378aee3aa5c84e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,77,97,74,156,17,150,198,32,134,0,29,211,120,174,227,170,92,132,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
