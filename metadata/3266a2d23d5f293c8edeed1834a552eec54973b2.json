Once I had found them for myself, I decided to correct that oversight. The .rar file contains a text index and a number of .pdf's, each containing one section of the diagrams covering one system (power windows, headlights, or cooling system; to name a few). I hope somebody else will find this useful.\n\nShare and Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3266a2d23d5f293c8edeed1834a552eec54973b2","amp;dn":"ALL+1995+Ford+Taurus+Wiring+Diagrams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3266a2d23d5f293c8edeed1834a552eec54973b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,102,162,210,61,95,41,60,142,222,237,24,52,165,82,238,197,73,115,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
