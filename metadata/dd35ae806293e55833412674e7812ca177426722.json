But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.\r\n\r\nDirector: Ridley Scott\r\nWriters: Drew Goddard (screenplay), Andy Weir (book)\r\nStars: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig \r\nGenres: Adventure | Drama | Sci-Fi\r\nCountry: USA\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE: The.Martian.2015.HC.HDRip.X264.AC3-EVO    \r\n                                        \r\nSOURCE: A friend...

A fix was necessary on the audio aswell,\r\n               since it had sync issues. Overall, pretty good do and its watchable.\r\n\r\nNOTES: Enjoy.        \r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/PLh \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/PLb \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/PL3 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/PL9 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/PLM \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/PLU \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/PLz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd35ae806293e55833412674e7812ca177426722","amp;dn":"The.Martian.2015.HC.HDRip.X264.AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd35ae806293e55833412674e7812ca177426722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,53,174,128,98,147,229,88,51,65,38,116,231,129,44,161,119,66,103,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
