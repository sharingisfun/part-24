Traffic and Weather had some snap on its surface, thanks largely to the bandmembers running with their encyclopedic pop eclecticism, letting themselves sonically accentuate their witticisms with passing production allusions, but Sky Full of Holes is an adult alternative pop record through and through, unfussy and unfettered by unnecessary accouterments. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not necessarily drab -- Ã¢â‚¬Å“Radio BarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ speeds along with the assistance of blaring horns mimicking the vocal line -- but it is straightforward, the songs never reaching beyond the expected, the color never seeping outside of the lines. Straightforward doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean tired, either. Chris Collingwood and Adam SchlesingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s specialty as songwriters has always been turning a trope inside out, finding ways to freshen or invert convention, and while they havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lost that knack, the directness of Sky Full of Holes turns their tunes into something approaching standard-issue. Of course, savvy semi-satirists that they are, Fountains of Wayne are fully aware when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re skirting clichÃƒÂ©, particularly when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve resorted to writing Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Road Song,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and they have the skill to keep proceedings tuneful and funny, but this dexterity doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always keep Sky Full of Holes from becoming just a tad too comfortable.
