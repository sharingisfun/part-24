The plot centers on Compte Hector de Sainte Hermine, a royalist captured and imprisoned by Bonaparte. Part one finds him caught in the political intrigue of 1801ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1804, as Napoleon moves from first consul to emperor. In part two, Hector, now known as RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, is released from jail; he signs onto a French corsair as a common seaman, but his noble birth, superb education and martial abilities soon elevate him in rank. The next 300 pages slosh with swashbuckling sea adventure, casting heroic romance against the background of Napoleon's ultimate fall. It's Dumas at his best, but alloyed: asides; minibiographies; commentaries on fashion, manners, geography and history; and flashbacks pile up unendingly, leavened with farcical humor and witty punditry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce323c3d6a1537eb28becd12d0bbef5505a08b9d","amp;dn":"The+Last+Cavalier+%28by+Alexandre+Dumas%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce323c3d6a1537eb28becd12d0bbef5505a08b9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,50,60,61,106,21,55,235,40,190,205,18,208,187,239,85,5,160,139,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
