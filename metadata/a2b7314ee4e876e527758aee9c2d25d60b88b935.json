When this group formed, they took one of wrestling's most famous good guys with them- the Charismatic Enigma, wrestling's free-spirited daredevil, Jeff Hardy. As shocking as the legdrop heard round the world, Jeff's crutch blasts to Angle and Anderson shocked the wrestling world. They lasted a year and a half before it all fell apart. Now, relive their rise and fall, from the formation at Bound For Glory 2010, to the final dissolution at Lockdown 2012, and every Pay-Per-View in between.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2b7314ee4e876e527758aee9c2d25d60b88b935","amp;dn":"TNA.The.Rise.And.Fall.Of.Immortal.PPV.Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2b7314ee4e876e527758aee9c2d25d60b88b935","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,183,49,78,228,232,118,229,39,117,138,238,156,45,37,214,11,136,185,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
