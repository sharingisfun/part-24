This included political surveillance, eavesdropping, detention, and interrogation. The revelation of illegal activities over many years shocked the American public and led to investigations of the CIA by a presidential commission and committees in both houses of Congress, which found evidence of more abuse, even CIA plans for assassinations. Investigators and the public soon discovered that the CIA abuses were described in a top-secret document agency insiders dubbed the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Family Jewels.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ That document became ground zero for a political firestorm that lasted more than a year. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Family JewelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ debacle ultimately brought about greater congressional oversight of the CIA, but excesses such as those uncovered in the 1970s continue to come to light. \nThe Family Jewels probes the deepest secrets of the CIA and its attempts to avoid scrutiny. John Prados recounts the secret operations that constituted Ã¢â‚¬Å“JewelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and investigatorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pursuit of the truth, plus the strenuous effortsÃ¢â‚¬â€by the agency, the executive branch, and even presidentsÃ¢â‚¬â€to evade accountability. Prados reveals how Vice President Richard Cheney played a leading role in intelligence abuses and demonstrates that every type of Ã¢â‚¬Å“JewelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has been replicated since, especially during the post-9/11 war on terror. The Family Jewels masterfully illuminates why these abuses are endemic to spying, shows that proper relationships are vital to control of intelligence, and advocates a system for handling Ã¢â‚¬Å“Family JewelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ crises in a democratic society","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b5eb5328f89ef1a502da6b6eed1adebd34248c","amp;dn":"Family+Jewels%2C+The+-+John+Prados","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b5eb5328f89ef1a502da6b6eed1adebd34248c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,181,235,83,40,248,158,241,165,2,218,107,110,237,26,222,189,52,36,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
