An expanded version was releases as SHM-SACD in Japan in 2011.\nOne imagines that this collection was aimed at the total neophyte listener Ã¢â‚¬â€ taken in any other context, this is an odd collection of single sides by one of the premiere singles bands of the 1960s and early Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s. Does it start at the beginning, with either Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m the FaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ExplainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? No. Does it encompass many of the freestanding singles issued by this band through 1972? No. Does it even offer any of the less well-known single sides from that period? No Ã¢â‚¬â€ apart from the three-and-a-half-minute single edit of Ã¢â‚¬Å“WonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get Fooled Again,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which was hardly a sterling example of the format or the genre. Instead, listeners get all of the most familiar hits, albeit in their original mono mixes where relevant: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Substitute,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a Boy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pictures of Lily,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Can See for Miles,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pinball Wizard,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Squeeze Box,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ etc. The best of it overlaps with Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy, among other collections, so veteran collectors and listeners will find nothing unique here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86c40e01b9a7e2b2e6490e0b8d829c7e1fea0856","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+The+Singles+%282011+SHM-SACD+rip%2C+flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86c40e01b9a7e2b2e6490e0b8d829c7e1fea0856","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,196,14,1,185,167,226,178,230,73,14,11,141,130,156,126,31,234,8,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
