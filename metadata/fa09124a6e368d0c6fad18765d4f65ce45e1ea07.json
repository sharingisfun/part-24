The number of orphans rises continually, but who can say what happens to their parents? Plenty of the bodies are never found. This is not the stuff of happy, careless childhoods, it is instead fertile ground for personal demons. In Hopeless, the demons are not always abstract concepts. Some of them have very real teeth, and very real horns.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa09124a6e368d0c6fad18765d4f65ce45e1ea07","amp;dn":"Hopeless+Maine+Vol.+1+%282012%29+%28Digital%29+%28Vee-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa09124a6e368d0c6fad18765d4f65ce45e1ea07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,9,18,74,110,54,141,12,111,173,24,118,93,79,101,206,69,225,234,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
