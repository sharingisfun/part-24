THE GI REVOLT - David Zeiger, USA, 2005 - The story of how active-duty American GIs, in their thousands, created a massive, unprecedented movement against the war in Vietnam that could not be stopped.\n\nAmerican documentary maker David Zeiger turns his attention to a movement he was part of - GIs against the Vietnam War. Though there has been much coverage of anti-war protests by students and civilians, the role of active servicemen, including the 500,000 who deserted over the course of the war, has been largely covered up.\n\nZeiger has unearthed a wealth of previously unseen footage, from moving footage shot by frontline soldiers, to GI produced anti-war newspapers. The programme gained exclusive rights to several documentaries revealing Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland&amp;#039;s revue company performing to troops in the Far East and Fonda was persuaded to give an interview reflecting on the time.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sirnosir.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sirnosir.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\non the tracker at http://conspiracycentral.net:6969\nforums at http://conspiracycentral.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92a2816a2441ace0023c6ded378a11ba79e9fc4d","amp;dn":"Sir.No.Sir.2005.LiMiTED.FS.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92a2816a2441ace0023c6ded378a11ba79e9fc4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,162,129,106,36,65,172,224,2,60,109,237,55,138,17,186,121,233,252,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
