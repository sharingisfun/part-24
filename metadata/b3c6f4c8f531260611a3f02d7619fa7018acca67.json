Also, this anniversary release is some 20 minutes longer in duration.\n \nThe album is a sort of concept album.It deals with Rick&amp;#039;s lady-friend Millie (later to become his wife) who suffered from clinical depression. The album tells Rick&amp;#039;s story of her journey into, through and out of the depression which naturally caused both of them a tremendous lot of agony and despair but also, eventually, much relief, joy and gratitude for being alive, as she got well.\n\nI ripped it using Nero7 which rejoined the tracks into an .iso file. Burn the image as you would a normal cd audio.\n\nYou need a dts decoder to be able to hear the music, either in you cd-r compatible dvd player, or in your surround amplifier which must be fed from the player&amp;#039;s &quot;digital out&quot; port. Otherwise, there will only be &quot;digital noise&quot;-like sound coming from your speakers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3c6f4c8f531260611a3f02d7619fa7018acca67","amp;dn":"%28dts%29+Rick+Wright+%5Bof+Pink+Floyd%5D+-+Broken+China","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3c6f4c8f531260611a3f02d7619fa7018acca67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,198,244,200,245,49,38,6,17,163,240,45,118,25,250,112,24,172,202,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
