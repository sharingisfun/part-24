His views on religion and science had truths, fair.\n\n        -Donald Danlag\n\nEntire review here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.epinions.com/review/Religion_and_Science_by_Bertrand_Russell_and_narrated_by_David_Case/content_239350746756&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.epinions.com/review/Religion_and_Science_by_Bertrand_Russell_and_narrated_by_David_Case/content_239350746756&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMore info on Russell: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26a10da2c8343dd64395bf97585bd1dbc949fcf9","amp;dn":"Bertrand+Russell+-+Religion+and+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26a10da2c8343dd64395bf97585bd1dbc949fcf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,161,13,162,200,52,61,214,67,149,191,151,88,91,209,219,201,73,252,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
