DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe it? Well, consider this: For nonbelievers, every day youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re alive is a day to celebrate! And no one celebrates life to the fullest like Penn JilletteÃ¢â‚¬â€the larger, louder half of legendary magic duo Penn &amp; TellerÃ¢â‚¬â€whose spectacularly witty and sharply observant essays in Every Day Is an Atheist Holiday! will entertain zealots and skeptics alike. \n\nWhether heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contemplating the possibility of life after death, deconstructing popular Christmas carols, or just calling bullsh*t on Donald TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apprentice training, Jillette does not fail to shock and delight his readers. And as ever, underneath these rollicking rants lie a deeply personal philosophy and a generous spirit, which find joy and meaning in family, and peace in the simple beauty of the everyday. Every Day Is an Atheist Holiday! is a hysterical affirmation of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magic from one of the most distinctly perceptive and provocative humorists writing today.  \n\n\nFormat: epub\n\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a42d3b40d6487120dafa4dd0cf1de07a2312a53","amp;dn":"Penn+Jillette+-+Every+Day+is+an+Atheist+Holiday%21%3AMore+Magical+Ta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a42d3b40d6487120dafa4dd0cf1de07a2312a53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,66,211,180,13,100,135,18,13,175,164,221,12,241,222,7,162,49,42,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
