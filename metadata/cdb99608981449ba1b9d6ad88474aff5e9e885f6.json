This time I will not list the version changes of the major applications, but limit myself to the most important changes. Debian has started to move 'Testing' to systemd. The Home editions use systemd while the Business editions continue to use sysvinit. For the Home editions, you will notice the difference during boot, but especially during shutdown which now takes a lot less time. We may still need your help to improve boot time, though. As from the last update, 'kdenext' was removed from SolydK. We are now tracking Debian KDE.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdb99608981449ba1b9d6ad88474aff5e9e885f6","amp;dn":"SolydK+201407+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdb99608981449ba1b9d6ad88474aff5e9e885f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,185,150,8,152,20,73,186,27,157,106,216,132,116,175,245,233,232,133,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
