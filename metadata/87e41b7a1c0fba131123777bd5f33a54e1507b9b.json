Ginzburg\n\nThis unusual book is a rare personal exploration of a wide range \nof current physics and astrophysics by a distinguished scientist; \nit was planned to educate budding scientists on important new\ntopics. \n\n\nAbout the book author says:\n\n     &quot;I came to the decision to write this book having in mind that there was so much interesting in various areas of physics and astrophysics and yet many budding physicists and students were not aware of this and could hardly find out for themselves. So I decided to do something constructive in this way, to describe briefly some urgent problems of physics and astrophysics.&quot;\n\n\n    Ginzburg is a generalist whose encyclopedic reading and depth permit coverage of a variety of such novel, specialized material. He uses order-of-magnitude (nearly dimensional) formulas, sufficient to provide quantitative estimates. He appreciates the experimenter's contribution. The book provides a model of how non-theorists can judge what realms of theory may be illuminated by work in a new range of photon and particle energy, how new technologies may be used to good effect.\n\nThe book has three sections dealing with Macrophysics, Microphysics and Astrophysics and in the end is full of references for each of the fields.\n\nThis book was translated from the Russian by Oleg Glebov and was first published by Mir in 1976 with a revised and enlarged edition in 1978. Link below is for 1978 print.\n\nPDF| OCR| Bookmarked| Cover| 11.1 MB\n\n\nPlease seed, share the torrent.\n\nReleased by mirtitles.org\n\n\nContents\n\nPreface\nPreface to the 1978 Edition\nIntroduction\n\n1.
