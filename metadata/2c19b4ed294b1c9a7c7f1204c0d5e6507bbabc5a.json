This is American Top 40, I'm Casey Kasem, and the countdown continues.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey reads from the AT40 Book of Records (before it's due back at the Countdown library). This week's honor goes to the man who accumulated more consecutive weeks in the top 40 than anyone else in the rock era. This man had a string of 23 hits which kept him on the chart for three-and-a-half years (which is about how long it was before the library eventually got their book back).\n\nThere is a famous musician in this countdown who has been nominated for 35 Grammys, four Oscars, two Emmys, has his first top 40 hit in this countdown, but when he gets angry, he still says, &quot;Well, I never!&quot;\n\nA listener writes in to ask, &quot;Has there ever been a record that hit the top 40, then fell out, then at a later date came back on the chart and hit number one?&quot; Casey says there have been two such yo-yo tricks, and gives the specifics.\n\nCasey gives his Special Report on Motown: the little record company that started with a $700 loan in 1960. By the end of the decade the Detroit based label had put more singles in the number one spot than any of its well established competition (but look, if I started a record company with the talents of Smokey Robinson, Gladys Knight, the Four Tops, and Marvin Gaye, I wouldn't even need the $700). \n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What group, other than the Beatles, has been the most successful on the charts?&quot; He says the line-up of this American group was all-female, and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, they worked for Motown! \n\nThere is a band in the countdown which once got this review, &quot;They are perverted, outrageous, violent, repulsive, ugly, tasteless, incoherent, a travesty, and that's what's good about them.&quot; That review was written by Geoffrey Cannon, then editor of &quot;The Radio Times, &quot;the official organ of the BBC.&quot; If I was in charge of any official organ, I would make Harpo Marx look like a blabber-mouth!\n\nFinally, I somehow didn't get the extras this week, but my assistant Amy found out what they were and even put in an &quot;extra&quot; extra. That's all folks!\n\n40: Macho Man - Village People\n39: Mr. Blue Sky - Electric Light Orchestra\n38: Two Tickets To Paradise - Eddie Money\n37: River Of Babylon - Boney M\n36: Fool If You Think It's Over - Chris Rea\n35: You - Rita Coolidge\n34: Stuff Like That - Quincy Jones\n33: Shame - Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King\n32: Love Or Something Like It - Kenny Rogers\n31: Thank God It's Friday - Love &amp; Kisses\n30: Can We Still Be Friends - Todd Rundgren\n29: An Everlasting Love - Andy Gibb\n28: Boogie Oogie Oogie - A Taste Of Honey\n27: I've Had Enough - Wings\n26: Hopelessly Devoted To You - Olivia Newton-John\n25: Songbird - Barbra Streisand\n24: King Tut - Steve Martin\n23: Stay - Jackson Browne\n22: FM - Steely Dan\n21: Bluer Than Blue - Michael Johnson\n20: Dance With Me - Peter Brown\n19: It's A Heartache - Bonnie Tyler\n18: I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight - Atlanta Rhythm Section\n17: Take A Chance On Me - ABBA\n16: Magnet And Steel - Walter Egan\n15: My Angel Baby - Toby Beau\n14: Life's Been Good - Joe Walsh\n13: Copacabana - Barry Manilow\n12: Runaway - Jefferson Starship\n11: Hot Blooded - Foreigner\n10: Love Will Find A Way - Pablo Cruise\n9: The Groove Line - Heatwave\n8: Use To Be My Girl - The O'Jays\n7: Still The Same - Bob Seger\n6: Three Times A Lady - Commodores\n5: Grease - Frankie Valli\n4: Last Dance - Donna Summer\n3: Miss You - Rolling Stones\n2: Baker Street - Gerry Rafferty \n1: Shadow Dancing - Andy Gibb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c19b4ed294b1c9a7c7f1204c0d5e6507bbabc5a","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_July_29th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c19b4ed294b1c9a7c7f1204c0d5e6507bbabc5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,25,180,237,41,75,28,154,124,127,18,4,192,213,230,80,123,186,188,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
