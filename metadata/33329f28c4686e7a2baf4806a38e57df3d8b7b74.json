In the Cuban-American Milian, J-Lo has found her heir apparent (not that she was looking): The songs spotlight a similar sex-i-fied energy, jumbling attitude, vulnerability, and a jigger of jadedness into a heaving, R&amp;B-leaning, red-hot heap. The secret is whip-smart production -- credit players who have worked with Alicia Keys, J-Lo, and Mariah Carey -- especially on &quot;I Need More,&quot; which showcases an array of pings, pulses, and from-the-gut guitar. When we're not singing along to lyrics like &quot;It'll be a cold day in hell before you see your girl shed another tear, boy you better hear me,&quot; bottom lip pushed out for emphasis, we're shouting &quot;go, girl&quot; from the sidelines. Or at least wanting to. If the radio hit &quot;Dip It Low&quot; hasn't pushed you to pick up this disc already, it is, in fact, about time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33329f28c4686e7a2baf4806a38e57df3d8b7b74","amp;dn":"Christina+Milian+-+It%5C%27s+About+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33329f28c4686e7a2baf4806a38e57df3d8b7b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,50,159,40,196,104,110,122,43,175,72,6,163,142,87,223,61,139,123,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
