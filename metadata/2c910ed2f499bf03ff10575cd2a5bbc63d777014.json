The duo sounds good ÃƒÂ¢?? they&amp;#039;re clean, tight, professional, not deviating much from the recorded versions but not doing much unexpected either. In other words, it&amp;#039;s precisely the kind of live set that is of considerable interest to hardcore fans but not many other kinds of listeners. Those fans should be satisfied though, as this contains the complete concert on both the CD and DVD, unlike some similar packages which truncate the CD portion of the show. \n\n--------\n\nThe Wreckers - Way Back Home-Live From New York City\n\n\nRip Info\n--------\n\nArtist: The Wreckers\nAlbum Title: Way Back Home-Live From New York City\nRecord Label: Warner Brothers Nashville\nRip Date: 2007-12-04\nCatalog Number:\nGenre: Country\nYear: 2007\nSource: CD\nEncoder: LAME 3.97 -V2 --vbr-new\nQuality: 198 kbps avg / 44.1KHz / Joint Stereo\n\n\nTrack List\n----------\n\n01 The Good Kind                                  4:15\n02 Love Me Like That                              4:26\n03 Way Back Home                                  4:27\n04 Damn That Radio                                3:31\n05 Crazy People                                   3:56\n06 Cigarettes                                     3:22\n07 My, Oh My                                      3:44\n08 Different Truck, Same Loser                    3:22\n09 Tennessee                                      6:32\n10 Lay Me Down                                    5:31\n11 Leave The Pieces                               5:40\n12 Stand Still, Look Pretty                       2:51\n13 Rain                                           4:57\n                                                --------\n                                                00:56:34\n                                                84.95 megs\n\nRip Notes\n---------\n\nWay Back Home: Live From New York City, recorded at the Bowery Ballroom on July\n13, 2006.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c910ed2f499bf03ff10575cd2a5bbc63d777014","amp;dn":"The_Wreckers-Way_Back_Home-Live_From_New_York_City-%282007-VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c910ed2f499bf03ff10575cd2a5bbc63d777014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,145,14,210,244,153,191,3,255,16,87,92,210,165,187,198,61,119,112,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
