This, his first graphic novel, is eagerly anticipated by comics connoisseurs who enjoy a sweet, unsentimental story about being a teenager and Rabagliati's crisp retro-modern 1950s drawing style. This book continues the story of Paul, a Quebecois teenager in the 1970s, as he experiences the first conflicts of responsibility with his desire to be free. Paul is outraged that he is forced to stop his high school art training. But he's been asked to put art aside because his other grades are so terribly low. Defiant, he quits school and anticipates a summer of leisure. But instead Paul follows the path of so many Quebecois teenagers: he lands a job as a counselor at one of the many summer camps in the mountains outside the city. There he finds himself guiding a motley band of kids, misfits and troublemakers, much like himself. \n\n\nSee also...\n\nMichel Rabagliati - Paul Moves Out, Adventures Of Paul  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7690851/Michel_Rabagliati_-_Paul_Moves_Out__Adventures_Of_Paul&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7690851/Michel_Rabagliati_-_Paul_Moves_Out__Adventures_Of_Paul&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:894cc1de3abbdd5ab87ab42fe0779f79accc560f","amp;dn":"Michel+Rabagliati+-+Paul+Has+A+Summer+Job","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"894cc1de3abbdd5ab87ab42fe0779f79accc560f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,76,193,222,58,187,221,90,184,122,180,47,224,119,159,121,172,204,86,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
